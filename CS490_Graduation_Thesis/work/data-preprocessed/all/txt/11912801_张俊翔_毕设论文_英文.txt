[ABSTRACT]: The aim of this graduation project is to use computers to re-
construct and simulate individual pedestrian trajectories at the individual level
in large cities, based on group-level statistical data. The trajectory reconstruc-
tion consists of two steps: firstly, using publicly available population survey
dataandpersonalactivitycharacteristicsgeneratedthroughdatasets,anactivity-
based behavior prediction model is employed to generate crowd trajectories
based on activity characteristics. The TimeGeo model is utilized and improved
to differentiate between commuters and non-commuters in terms of their be-
havioral patterns and simulate the main locations where crowds stay in the tra-
jectory reconstruction. Secondly, trajectory completion is performed for each
inter-stop trajectory. As the Tokyo dataset used in this graduation project has a
high proportion of rail transit travelers, special emphasis is placed on studying
rail transit behavior between different stop locations. The author proposes a
Markov chain-based rail transit network flow prediction model to analyze and
predict train passengers’ travel trajectories between different origins and des-
tinations. Finally, the author improves and proposes a trajectory generation
model that achieves improvements in metrics such as grid population accuracy
and OD flow accuracy compared to baseline models based on GAN models.

• How: how dopeople travelamonglocations?
By analyzing human mobility patterns, we can determine the sequence of locations

itiscrucialtounderstandhowindividualsmovefromoneplacetoanother.
However, determining the specific mode of transportation between locations is not a
straightforwardtask. Numerousfactorscomeintoplay,suchasanindividual’sdemographic
characteristics,economicstatus,theroadnetwork,availabilityofbuildingfacilities,andeven
weather conditions. Considering all these factors in this thesis would be overly extensive.
Therefore,thisthesiswillprimarilyfocusononeofthemostsignificanttransportationmodes
inmetropolitanareas,trains.
Hence, the objective of this research is to determine how individuals utilize trains for
theirjourneys,giventhesourceanddestinationlocations. Thesimplestapproachwouldbeto

2.1 Characteristics of Human Mobility
The study of human mobility holds paramount significance and has been extensively
exploredbyresearchersacrossvariousdisciplines,includingphysics,geography,transporta-
tion,andcomputerscience. Extensiveresearchhasfocusedoninvestigatingthefundamental
characteristicsofhumanmobility,providingatheoreticalbasisforestimatingtraveldemands
and generating travel trajectories. Notably, Brockmann et al.[9] discovered that the distribu-
tion of jump size and wait time in human activity follows a fat-tailed distribution. Song et

2.2 Periodicity of Traveling Behaviors
Moreover,throughtheanalysisofmobilephonerecords,Gonzalezetal.[6]demonstrated
the highly regular nature of human activity in terms of both spatial and temporal patterns.
They found that individual mobility patterns can be represented by probability distributions
associated with these characteristics. In contrast, Song et al.[11] measured the entropy of
individual trajectories and argued that despite the presence of general travel patterns, the
specifictrajectoryofanindividual,whichheavilyreliesondailyroutines,lackspredictabil-
ity. Schneideretal.[12] identifieddailyactivitymotifsthatcanpredictmobilitypatternsona
daily basis for months. Pappalardo et al.[13] discovered the recurrent nature of human travel
demands and introduced the concept of ”returners” and ”explorers” to elucidate the spatial-
temporal correlation in human mobility patterns. Additionally, Issacman et al.[14] proposed
a model that utilizes call detail records to predict the scale of migration among different
metropolitanareas.
2.3 Generation Models of Trajectories
With advancements in technology, the utilization of big data sources such as smart
cards[4,15], Wi-Fi[16], and call detail records (CDRs)[6] has become essential for studying hu-
man mobility. Various methods have been employed to generate human trajectories. For
instance, Joubert et al.[17] applied Bayesian Networks to investigate the causality of human
activity and generate mobility patterns using activity-based models. Yuan et al.[5] leveraged
neural differential equations to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of human activities
and generate trajectories. Activity-based methods, such as the time geography approach
proposed by Jiang et al.[8], have been adopted to generate human mobility trajectories, re-
placingtraditionalsurvey-basedorcensus-basedapproaches. Pappalardoetal.[18]developed
DITRAS,acomprehensiveframeworkforsimulatinghumanmobilitypatterns. Thisframe-

workincludesadata-drivenalgorithmthatcapturesindividuals’routine-breakingtendencies
and a trajectory generator based on preferential exploration and return, resulting in the gen-
eration of trajectories that accurately reproduce the statistical properties of real human mo-
bility. Furthermore, He et al.[19] proposed a framework for generating human mobility data
in new cities by transferring knowledge from source cities. Their approach encompasses
three stages: mobility intention transfer, origin-destination generation, and path generation,
whichwerevalidatedthroughextensiveexperimentsandacasestudyinanewlydeveloped
region. Feng et al.[20] introduced DeepMove, an attentional recurrent network that incorpo-
rates a multi-modal embedding recurrent neural network and a historical attention model.
DeepMove addresses challenges associated with complex sequential transition regularities,
multi-levelperiodicity,andheterogeneityinhumanmobilityprediction. Itoutperformsstate-
of-the-art models and provides interpretable predictions. Nguyen et al.[21] utilized social
networking data from Go Walla to collect and validate models of human mobility and rela-
tionships. Their objective was to provide more realistic movement and social relationship
models for the analysis and evaluation of applications in opportunistic networks and com-
plex mobile networks. In a similar vein, Hao et al.[22] introduced SHIFT, a novel approach
to human mobility forecasting. They treated it as a language translation task by employ-
ing a mobility-to-language template and utilizing a two-branch network to generate future
mobility descriptions. SHIFT offers an effective and groundbreaking method for predicting
humanmobilitypatterns.

dividuals halt in their daily mobility records. A stay point is defined as a location where an

4. Methodology
4.1 Activity-Based Models
Urban travel demands have been widely applied in many fields for policy makers, in-
cluding detecting traffic modes [6], generating temporal POIs of regions [7], detecting hu-
manflows[8],andconstructingtourismfootprint[9]. Toillustratetheurbantraveldemands,
activity-based model is introduced. There are mainly three states of the stay locations that
areassumedforindividualagents[5]: home,work,andothers.
Once the agent may have several stay locations that follows the H/W/O features , the
indexes of each state are used to mark the frequency of the agent in each state. (e.g., W0 is
themostfrequentworkplaceof theagent,W1isthesecondmostfrequent,andsoon).
Constructing activity models is not trivial. Traditionally, these models are based on
census or household travel surveys. Currently, many activity-based models are extracted
fromcellphonedata. Theinputforcurrentactivity-basedmodelsarecellphonerecords(e.g.,
CDRs, GPS trajectories, etc.), as a series of longitude-latitude-timestamp attributes. First,
stay-locations are detected from the series, around with relatively more densely scatters the
longitude-latitude points. Then, the stay-points are classified into the types of home, work,
andother,withthe rulesabove.
As key locations are extracted, the activities of a person can be abstracted into a series
ofkeylocations,withthenodeswithsemanticsofcoordinates,timestamps,andthelocation
types(oneofHome,Work,andOther). Asthenodesaggregate,thelinkedlistofkeylocation
isformed. Thus,thekeylocationseriesisalsoasemanticseries,whichispotentiallyableto
beprocessedwithNLPmodels. Inthispart,wearegoingtogeneratethekey-locationseries
with the extracted key locations from ground truth Tokyo trajectory data. The process can
beillustratedasFigure2:

In Ref. [5], human activities are a series of state transitions powered by travel demands. In

The decisions correspond to two choices: temporal choices, and spatial choices. Table 2

4.2.2 ModelingNon-WorkingChoices
During the time that the agent is not working, we need to determine that when she is
going to travel, and the destination for the travel. This decision process is given by EPR
model [3]. In EPR model, there are three parameters to describe the travel demand for an
individual:
• n : Weeklyhome-basedhometripnumber
w
• β Burstrate: likelihoodforchoosingtoexplore
1
• β Dwellrate: likelihoodforchoosingtomove
2
The time that one stays in the location t is sampled from a fat-tailed distribution. As
L
each t goes, the agent decides: to go home, to stay in the location, or travel to another

• If the agent is not at home, and she chooses to move, the probability she chooses to

During the non-working time, the location that the individual visits can be determined
throughtheprobabilityabove,andthe key-locationseriesaregenerated.
4.3 Markov-Train
4.3.1 TrainsasaMarkovChain
Out of the concern of the complexity, it is obvious that the railway network could be
a bidirectional graph, where the stations are nodes, the rail links are edges, and the trains
running on the railway and their passengers could be the edge features. Suppose that each
train-riding behavior is independent, when the train moves from one station to another one,
one iteration, or the state transition occurs. Figure 3 shows the railways and stations near
Xizhimen station in Beijing. Correspondingly, treating the stations and metro lines near
Xizhimenstation,theadjacentmatrixof thegraphisliketable3

we can build up the transition matrix of the Markov chain. In the matrix, the value in po-
sition (x, y) represents that: as the passenger is in station x (state x), the possibility that the
passengerwilltakethetraintostationy(theMarkovchainwilltransferitsstatetoy).
4.3.2 InitialStateofMarkov-Train
The Initial value for the transition matrix M could be like table 4, where the sum of
0
each column and each row is 1.0. Note that the value of M is non-zero only at where two
0
train stationsareconnected.
From the frequency of the passengers’ riding behavior among stations from Tokyo
dataset, we can initialize the Markov transition matrix of the railway system. The transi-
tion matrix is illustrated in figure 4. The station in the matrix includes Toei-Mita Line, and
Toei-Asakusa Line, two underground train lines operated by Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of
Transportation,whichgothroughmanytrainstationswithhugecapacityofpassengers.

4.3.3 IterationofMarkov-Train
AstheMarkovtrainiterates,the transitionmatrixiteratesas
M = M M

Physically, while the transition matrix iterates once, it indicates that all the passengers
intherailwaynetworktravelfromonestationtoanother,enteringthestation,orleavingthe
station. For example, M [x,y] means the passenger departs at station x, the probability for
30
the train to exist at station y after 30 “steps”. If the passenger travels to the same station
thathetravelsfrom,physicallyitindicatesthatthispassengergetsoffthetrainatthatstation.
Therefore, it statistically simulates the feature of the passengers’ train-riding behavior with
theMarkovChain.

5.1 Fitting the Individual Parameters in TimeGeo
AccordingtoJiangetal.[8],eachpersonhashisorherownpreferenceofgoingouthome,

byindividualparameters. Individualparametercapturesthecircadiumspatialactivitywhich
islessrelatedtotemporalfeatures. Thus,theindividualfeaturesmostlydescribeswherethe
person will determine to go while not at work, since working activity is treated as a pure-
temporal activity (work location has a fixed start-time, duration, and location, where only
the first two of them need to be determined. There are three individual parameters for one
person:
14
• Weekly-BasedTourNumber: n

• DwellRate: β ,tocapturetheprobabilityofgoinghome while atother locations.

• Burst Rate: β , to capture the probability of going out to explore while the person

Specifically, these three individual parameters in an area (e.g. in a city) follows distri-
butions. Theyfollowthedistributionsbelow

Thus, the distribution of the people living in an area can be inferred from the ground
truth key-location activity series of the people. Weekly-based tour number is calculated by

by the percentage of people who come home as the next step while they are not working
(the weight of O − H series out of all O −∗ series). Burst rate is given by the percentage
of people who travel out home while they just came back home (the weight of O −H −O

5.2 Implementation of TimeGeo
The model is implemented based on Scikit-mobility package[24]. Scikit-mobility is a
Pythonlibrarythatoffersarangeoftoolsforanalyzing,simulating,andevaluatingmobility
data. Overthelastdecade,theincreasingavailabilityofvastmobilitydatasets,suchasGPS
tracks,calldetailrecords,andsocialmediaposts,hasledtoagrowinginterestinthestudyof
human mobility patterns. Scikit-mobility aims to provide a comprehensive environment to
support researchers and practitioners in addressing challenges such as data cleaning, statis-
tical analysis, and synthetic trajectory generation. This efficient and user-friendly package
buildsonthecapabilitiesofthepopularPythonlibrarypandasandincludesfeaturessuchas
16
visualization of trajectories, synthetic data generation, statistical pattern analysis, and pri-
vacy risk assessment. There are mainly four classes in the implementation code: TimeGeo,
WorkChoice, HomeOtherChoice, and RankedEPR. RankedEPR overrides the original EPR
model in scikit-mobility package, and HomeOtherChoice model (i.e. the spatial decision of
theuser)usesRankedEPR modeltochoose thenext-location.
5.2.1 GeneratingWorkingBehavior
With government survey records of transportation[25], we can obtain the statistical fea-
ture of the start time and duration of work time and work-break time, we can construct the
joint-distributionbetweenthestarttimeandthedurationforworktimeandwork-breaktime.
Correspondingly, the individual working feature can be sampled from the distribution. The
samplingresultslikefigure8and9.

5.2.2 GeneratingNon-WorkingBehaviorsofTimeGeo
With the fitted individual parameters from section 5.1, we can indicate the probability
that people travel among home, work, and other locations. Given the specific labeled lo-
cations for the exact type, we can generate the temporal sequence of the key-locations. A
sampleofthegeneratednon-workingkey-locationseriesislikefigure10.

5.3 Generating Trajectories via Key-Location Sequences
Withworkingbehaviorandnon-workingbehaviorthatisgenerated,thewholesequence
of key location can be generated, which contains the timestamps, longitudes, latitudes, and
location-types.
Thegeneration of trajectory goes with the following steps: First, to determine whether
the person is a commuter, if so, determine the home and the work location of the person.
Second, determine the work schedule by sampling from the distribution given by the gov-
ernment statistical data. Then, for the time that the person is neither at work not at home,
determine the locations (in other location type) that the person travels to. Some generated
sequenceoflocationsarelikefigure11.
5.4 Generating Trajectories without Knowledge of People’s Activities
Due to privacy concerns, in many cases we cannot obtain the high-resolution ground-
truth trajectories of cellphone users. Regarding this circumstance, we can also generate the
trajectoriesofpeople withlimitedspatialknowledge ofthecity. Forexample,POIs.
Here, we added up the POI of Shanghai to the activity-based model, and generated the
trajectoriesofpeople inShanghaiwithoutknowingGPSorCDRrecords,infigure12.

ing of the riding of the trains that the number of iterations infers that the number of stations

The iterated result is shown in figure 13. From the iterated result, we can find that the
values of the stations have differed, and some stations are specifically popular than others
(likeTokyo,Shinjuku,Shibuya,andShinbashi). Together,somepairsofstationshavecome

Meanwhile, the result of convergence also differ among different hours that people

Thebaselineisrandom-walkalgorithmintheGAN-generatedlifepatterns,asP.Lihas

listed in table 5. From the table we can see that the proposed model have less MSE and

Table5 EvaluationIndicators
Static and dynamic indicators are both included to evaluate the models. The static in-
dicator used in this study is grid population, which represents the number of users located
withineachcorrespondinggrid,typicallyasquareofafewhundredmeters. Gridpopulation
providesvaluableinsightsintothespatialdistributionofthepopulationataspecificpointin

To visualize the spatial distribution of the population, heat maps of the grid population
are presented in Figure 15, 16, and 17. These heat maps offer a comprehensive view of
populationdensityacrossthecity,highlightingareaswithhighconcentrationsofindividuals.

By comparing the generated trajectories with the ground truth, we can observe that
the TimeGeo-based model demonstrates superior performance in capturing the clusters of
population in the city center, as well as the radiation lines extending from downtown to
suburban areas. This is evident in Figure 18 and 19, which illustrate the grid population
values obtained from the TimeGeo-based model and the baseline model, respectively, in
comparisontothe groundtruthvalues.
The dynamic indicator used in this study is OD flow, which represents the number of
people traveling from one grid to another. OD flow provides valuable insights into the spa-
tiotemporal characteristics of human flows. It serves as a crucial measure to understand the
dynamicmovementpatternsofindividualsinanurbanenvironment. ThesignificanceofOD

To visualize the OD population among grids, Figure 20 and 21 depict the distribution
of OD flow. These figures highlight the spatial and temporal patterns of human movement,
allowing us to identify areas with high travel demand and explore the connections between
differentlocations.
Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits improved performance, as evidenced by a
higher concentration of data points closer to the ideal y = x line. This indicates that the
model successfully captures and predicts the actual OD flow, resulting in a more accurate
representationofhumantrajectories.

7. Conclusion
Trajectoriesarewidelyusedinmanyfieldsofstudies,includingurbanplanning,trans-
portation,riskmanagement,orbusiness. Whilethegroundtruthtrajectoryrecordsarehighly
sensitive,andunavailableforresearchers. Thisresearchproposesmethodstoresolvethein-
accessibility for trajectories. With knowing the basic features of human activity, we can
reconstruct and simulate the trajectories of people living in the area, and guarantee that re-
constructedtrajectorieshavethesameaggregated-levelandindividual-levelcharacteristicof
the open statistical data. Based on this goal, we introduced activity-based models to recon-
structthe trajectoriesfromaggregatedfeaturesandincompletetrajectories.
This work has discussed the solutions to the “Where”and “How”issues. Trajec-
tories are generated with characteristics of people’s travel activities. Activities models like
TimeGeo, are implemented and deployed in generating moving sequences in cities. With
the human mobility records, we have abstracted the key locations and circadian behavior
of the users. From the indicators, we have found that the temporal features are well illus-
tratedinTokyodataset,whilethespatialfeature,especiallyfortraveldistance,needsfurther
improvement. Also,thetrain-takingbehaviorfor passengersarealsodiscussed.
Then,POI’sareintroducedtowidertherangeofTimeGeo,andgeneratedprojectswith-
out prior knowledge of people’s trajectories with the known activity features. With the mo-
bilitypatternsthatisabstractedfromthegroundtruthtrajectories,orcollectedfromthegov-
ernment statistical data, we can then generated delicate location-visit sequences from the
activity-basedmodels. Thisappliesintheconditionsthatwhiletheprivacycodeisstrictand
researcherscannothave accesstoanyoriginalindividualtrajectories.
There are still some limitations in the study. TimeGeo is too rough for the location
choice. It only considers distance as the sorting factor for the candidate locations, which is
far from the real-world scenario, which much more complicated and related to more issues
like accessibility, transportation, or the people’s demographic features. Markov-Train still
needs criteria to evaluate its performance. For the future work, more detailed activity fea-
30
