1. Introduction
1.1 Background and motivation for the research
The manufacturing industry is undergoing a transformation as blockchain
technologies have been developed. The blockchain technologies have the potential to
improve efficiency, transparency, and traceability in the manufacturing process,
leading to better quality products and increased customer satisfaction. However, one
challenge the industry is facing is how to efficiently store and securely share
large-scale datain a multi-cloud environment.
1.2 Research objectives and contributions
To address this challenge, I propose a blockchain-based data sharing system for
smart manufacturing. The system is based on a consortial blockchain framework that
leverages the benefits of distributed ledger technology to provide a reliable and
tamper-proof data sharing mechanism.The proposed system is designed to cater to the
specific needs of the manufacturing industry, addressing the challenges of efficient
storage and secure and effective sharing of large-scale data in a multi-cloud
environment.
1.3 Overview of the thesis
In this thesis, the objective of the research is to design a blockchain-based data
sharing system to meet specific needs in the smart manufacturing industry. The
system aims to address challenges such as efficient storage and secure sharing of
large-scale data in a multi-cloud environment. To accomplish this objective, I propose
a system design based on a consortium blockchain framework and provide
comprehensive descriptions of its architecture, identifiers, encoding, and parsing
protocols.
This thesis proposes a blockchain-based data sharing system that provides a
reliable and tamper-resistant mechanism for data sharing in the smart manufacturing
industry. By designing a consortium blockchain framework specifically tailored to the
industry's needs and providing detailed designs of the system architecture, identifiers,
4
encoding, and parsing protocols, specific technical solutions are offered for
implementing the system. This novel approach to data sharing offers economic
benefits and competitive advantages to stakeholders in the smart manufacturing
industry, fostering innovation and industry growth. The remainder of this thesis is
organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of blockchain technology and
its applications in manufacturing. Section 3 presents my proposed methodology in
detail, including the design of the system architecture (Section 3.1) and the identifier
design (Section 3.2). The results and discussion are presented in Section 4. Finally,
Section 5concludes withrecommendations for laterwork.
2. Literature Review
2.1 Overview of blockchain technology and its application
Smart manufacturing is becoming increasingly important in the global
manufacturing industry.
Investment in smart manufacturing paves the way for increased efficiency,
production, process quality, energy savings, saving on fixed costs in the long term,
increased reactivity tochanges and increased competitiveness in theglobal market.
As detailed in the White House Critical and Emerging, the manufacture of Smart
is anational focus.
This is an opportunity to create new business value and to dismantle the existing
manufacturing value chain through the injection of appropriate technology. The new
model of value creation opens up an avenue for myriad innovation opportunities and
also encourages organisations to befar moreagile.
Blockchain technology has vast opportunities and benefits for improving . Some
benefits of using blockchain for data management and sharing in smart manufacturing
include improved inventory management, improved data security, improved
transparency and traceability, automated vendor payments, and improved customer
engagement .

2.2 Related works
Related technologies for data sharing fall into two categories. With the former
focusing on the security and the latter focusing on frameworks for sharing data. I will
introducethem independently in what follows.
2.2.1Security
In[1],this paper proposes an attribute-based dynamicaccess control scheme .In [2],
their proposal involves a solutionfor lightweight proxyre-encryption, which involves
theconstruction of apre-encryptionalgorithm and thedevelopment ofa
certificate-free protocol. This protocol eliminates theneed for bilinearpairs and is
highly efficient in terms of performance. As an example, Qin's work [3]involves the
useofcomputed tokens that traverse domains in order to minimizecomputational
overheads for users accessing data. Qin also conducted additional research to
implementaccess control mechanisms, as described in [4,5].This approach can help
improvetheefficiency and security ofdata sharing across different domains. Several
otherstudies have also explored theintersection of theinternet ofthings, privacy, and
safety. Thesestudies, including[6~9],haveinvestigated various approaches to
enhancing thesecurity and privacy ofnetworks.
2.2.2Frameworks
Various frameworks are proposed depending onthe scenario. One approach is on
the basis a centralized server framework that collects and organizes shared data stored
on different cloud platforms into a unified format, and stores it on a centralized server
for user access. When a user wants they can share data by retrieving the unified
formatted data to be located and obtained the desired information. While this
framework is highly effective, it does have a potential issue with a sole point of
failure(SPOF). In the event of a centralized server failure, users may experience
significant losses in both data and economic value. It is important to consider this
potential risk and implement measures to mitigateit.
Another is based on blockchain technology. It stores and manages data using a
distributed ledger of blockchain. Unlike centralized server-based frameworks,
6
blockchain-based frameworks do not require a single central server to store and
manage data, but instead manage data through a distributed node network. This
decentralized architecture makes data more secure because there is no single point
that can be attacked or damaged by a failure. And due to the encryption and
verification mechanisms of blockchain technology, data in blockchain-based
frameworks is more difficult to tamper with or damage. Therefore, this framework is
very suitable for storing sensitive data such as financial and medical data. However,
its disadvantages include potential performance issues, high costs, and privacy
concerns.
2.2.3Challenges andlimitations of existingsolutions
Additionally, there is a need to enhance the robustness of these existing methods,
as discussed earlier. Secondly, it is worth noting that some existing approaches to data
validation rely solely on a single signature check, which may not be sufficient to meet
the needs of users in the era of big data[10]. As data volumes continue to grow, it
becomes increasingly important to ensure that data is not only authentic but also
accurate and reliable.
3.Methodology
To overcome the challenges mentioned above, I propose a new system based on
the blockchain consortium. It is more efficient than the public chains such as Bitcoin
or Ethereum. There is a network of nodes which are responsible for verifying and
validating transactions. These nodes are typically owned and operated by different
participants in the manufacturing ecosystem, such as manufacturers, suppliers, and
distributors. The system is designed with a encoding-parsing algorithm. Also for the
performance of storing large data blocks, the system uses cloud storage or distributed
databases.
7
Fig.1
3.1 System architecture design
The simplified system architecture depicted in Figure 1 consists of several key
components, including data owners, data users, cloud storage, and networks. By
leveraging these different elements, the system is able to facilitate the secure and
efficient sharing of data across multiple domains. Data owners upload their
information by performing the registration process and thus become the managers of
their own data in the cloud. Meanwhile, data users can access this information as
needed, with appropriate access controls in place to ensure that sensitive data remains
protected. Theworkflow of thesystem can bedescribed as follows:
a) Data owners are responsible for uploading their data to the cloud and
registering it on the blockchain network. This allows them to maintain complete
control over theirinformation, including theability tomodify or deleteit as needed.
b) Data users are defined as individuals or entities who make use of shared data
and have the ability to query and access information uploaded by other users. This
allows for a collaborative approach to data sharing, with users able to leverage the
insights and knowledge ofothers in ordertoachieve theirgoals.
c) Once data has been recorded on the blockchain network, it can be shared
among users and stored in multi-clouds forsafekeeping.
8
d) As a fundamental component of the system, the blockchain is responsible for
storing metadata and managing the processes involved in encoding and analyzing data
identifiers. This includes recording key information about each piece of data, such as
its source, format, and content, as well as ensuring that it is properly encrypted and
secured against unauthorized access ormanipulation.
Thedetailed design oftheprotocolswill bediscussed in thefollowingsections.
Ethereum can be integrated with any blockchain through smart contracts.
However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin may not be the most efficient option for large
data-sharing systems due to its inherent limitations. Alternative solutions, such as
Permacoin, have been proposed to address these issues[11]. Moreover, selfish mining
attacks have been reported to occur in theBitcoin network[12].
The proposed system differs from existing methods primarily in the way that
metadata is stored and managed. Unlike traditional approaches, which often rely on
centralized databases or file systems to store metadata, the proposed system leverages
thepower ofblockchain technology toprovide amore secure and transparent platform
for managing this critical information. In the proposed system, metadata is stored on
the blockchain, and the features of blockchains and smart contracts are utilized to
implement the systems functions. However, this approach introduces a potential issue:
new nodes must obtain a full copy of the metadata before joining the system, which
can lead tosecurity and efficiency concerns[13].
To address these challenges, the proposed system could incorporate the
following enhancements:
a) Implement a more efficient blockchain network, such as Ethereum or other
alternatives, toimprove theoverall performance ofthesystem.
b) Introduce a mechanism for partial metadata retrieval, allowing new nodes to
obtain only the necessary metadata instead of the entire dataset. This can help reduce
theburden onnewnodes and improvesystem efficiency.
c) Employ advanced encryption techniques to protect the metadata stored on the
blockchain, ensuring thesecurity and privacy ofdata owners and users.
d) Develop a robust data verification protocol to prevent unauthorized access and
9
manipulationof data, further enhancing thesecurity ofthe system.
By incorporating these improvements, the proposed system can effectively
address the limitations of existing data-sharing methods while leveraging the
advantages of blockchain technology and smart contracts. This will result in a more
secure, efficient, and scalable solution for dataowners andusers alike.
3.2 Identifier design
In order to enhance the efficiency of my proposed system, I have designed a
unique system of pairs of short and long identifiers. One of the key features of this
system is its unique approach to data representation, which involves the use of both
short and long identifiers.
By leveraging this approach, users are able to represent data using short
identifiers that are easy to manage and share, while also benefiting from more
comprehensive descriptions of the data provided by the long identifiers. This allows
for a more flexible and efficient approach to data management, with users able to
quickly and easily access key information about each pieceof dataas needed.
When updates are made to the data, the long identifier is modified in order to
reflect these changes. However, the short identifier remains constant, providing a
stable reference point for users even as the underlying data evolves over time. This
helps to ensure that users can easily track changes and updates to the data without
having to constantly update their own records or references. Additionally, by
separating out metadata from the underlying data itself, this approach helps to
improve overall system performance and scalability while reducing complexity and
overhead.
Since each piece of data has only one short identifier, it is crucial for it to be
unique. In the system, I utilize syndicate chains where each user has a distinct
certification. The hash of these certifications, denoted as cert_hash, is used as a prefix
for the short identifier. Data owners assign unique names to their data within their
User Domain, and these names are appended as a suffix to the cert_hash. This creates
a complete short identifier that is unique within the Global Domain. Then the
10
certification hash is away to accelarateuser interactions and storingpublickeys.
The long identifier, on the other hand, consolidates all metadata into a single
identifier, which also serves as a tool for metadata management. The system is
designed to provide users with a seamless and intuitive way to access information by
leveraging thepower ofmetadata.
By consolidating all metadata into a single long identifier, the system enables
users to easily retrieve key information about each piece of data simply by accessing
the long identifier. This system allows for seamless integration and management of
metadata withinthelong identifier.
In summary, the identifier pairs offer several advantages, including uniqueness
and human readability. These identifiers cater to the dynamic nature of data, and the
short identifier prefix is connected to the owner’s identity, thus mitigating security
concerns suchas counterfeiting[14].
To further elaborate on the benefits and implementation of this system, the
following pointscan beconsidered:
The dual identifier system allows for efficient data management and retrieval,
enabling users toquickly locate and access theinformation they need.
The unique short identifiers ensure that data remains distinguishable, even when
updates or modifications are made, thereby maintaining data integrity within the
system.
The long identifiers provide a comprehensive overview of the metadata, making
it easier for users to understand the context and relevance of the data they are
accessing.
The identifier pairs can be easily integrated with blockchain technology and
smart contracts, ensuring secure and transparent data sharing among users.
By linking the short identifier prefix to the owner’s identity, the system can
effectively prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of data, further enhancing the
security and privacy of dataowners and users.
Incorporating these features, the proposed system presents a robust and efficient
solution for data management and sharing, leveraging the advantages of both short
11
and long identifiers, as well as the security and transparency offered by blockchain
technology andsmart contracts.

3.3 Encoding and parsing protocols design
3.3.1Encodingprotocol
The identifier encoding protocol is designed to facilitate data registration and
sharing in the system. It provides a standardized process for data owners to register
theirdata inthe blockchain system. The protocol consists offoursteps:
a) Data owners upload theirdata to thecloud storage.
b) The cloud storage stores the data and returns the URL of the data to the data
owner.
c) Data owners send a registration request to the blockchain network, indicating their
intentiontoshare thedata withothers.
d) The blockchain network generates a short identifier and a long identifier for the
dataand returns theshort identifier to thedata owners.
The identifier encoding protocol has several advantages. First, it ensures the
uniqueness of identifiers, as the blockchain generates short identifiers using the
combination of data name, digital signature, and transaction hash. Second, the
protocol allows data owners to manage their data metadata through long identifiers.
Third, the protocol is easy to use, as data owners only need to follow the four-step
process toregister and sharetheir data.
Compared to other systems like Ethereum and Bitcoin, the identifier encoding
protocol in the system is designed to overcome their limitations. For example, in
Ethereum, users need to repeatedly try to find a unique identifier[15], while in Bitcoin,
13
users cannot name their own identifiers[16]. the identifier encoding protocol provides a
moreefficient and user-friendly solution fordata registration and sharing.
Fig.2Identifier encoding protocol
3.3.2Parsing protocol
The identifier parsing protocol is designed to enable data users to query data
using short identifiers, while keeping the long identifiers invisible to users. This
protocol consists of four steps, where data users first send a query request with a short
blockchain identifier; which then executes the parsing process and sends the URL of
the metadata back to the users of the data. The data users can then send a query
request to the cloud to obtain the data, and the clouds will send the data to the data
users.
The parsing process works by retrieving the extract the long identifier from the
key pair, use the short identifier as the key, and then retrieve the necessary metadata
from the long identifier. The metadata required in this protocol is the URL. This
makes it easy for data users to obtain data with only one short identifier, and provides
aconvenient way toimplement extended functions that require certain metadata.
This protocol is important because it ensures that data users can securely and
easily access data with short identifiers, while keeping the long identifiers and other
sensitive metadata hidden from users. It also provides a secure and efficient way to
retrieve metadata, and allows forexpanded functions to beeasily implemented.
14
Fig.3Parsing protocol
3.3.3Updating protocol
In order to address the dynamic nature of data and the need for frequent updates,
the system has been designed with a robust protocol for updating identifiers. This
protocol enables data owners to easily update their data both in the cloud and on the
blockchain, ensuring that all relevant information is kept up-to-date and accurate. By
providing a flexible and scalable approach to data management, this protocol helps to
ensure that users can easily adapt to changing circumstances and evolving data
requirements. Whether it's a minor update or a major overhaul of the underlying data,
this protocol provides a streamlined and efficient way to make changes while
minimizingdisruptionor downtime.
The identifier updating protocol is designed to allow updating the data in the
cloud and blockchain. This protocol consists of four steps. In step one, data owners
send an updating request to clouds with the new version of data. Then the cloud
response with a new URL. And user sand an updating request with the new URL to
the blockchain. In the fourth step blockchain reproduces the long identifier and sends
reply totheowners ofthe data.
The system has been designed to provide a robust and secure approach to
managing metadata and user information. By leveraging the power of long identifiers,
the system enables users to easily store and retrieve key-value pairs along with new
values, ensuring that all relevant information is readily accessible and up-to-date. In
15
addition, the system's use of blockchain technology provides an added layer of
security and authentication.
Fig.4Updating protocol
3.3.4Data check protocol
After the complete download of data, it is natural to consider data verification.
Data users should check theprotocol to ensure itsvalidity:
a) whether data has been tampered;
b) Whetherthedata isindeed provided bytheexpected dataowner.
Thisverification process is outlined inFigure 4and consists ofthree stages:
a) Data users initiatea dataverification query to theblockchain.
b) Upon receiving the request, the blockchain retrieves the user_sig and user_pubkey
metadata and sends it back to thedatausers as aresponse.
c) Successful verification in the third stage confirms that the data corresponds to the
short identifier.
This confirmation is based on the fact that the user_sig is generated using the
short identifier, providing evidence that the data was provided by the expected data
owner. The verification process adds a crucial layer of security and authentication,
ensuring that only authorized parties can access or modify the data. The use of
user_pubkey in theaudit process further supports thisconfirmation.

4. Performance Benchmark and analysis
4.1 Performance Benchmark
The proposed system has been benchmarked against two well-established
systems, Ethereum[17] and Bitcoin[18], both of which have been successfully
implemented and widely accepted by a large user base. Performance and scalability
are challenges for the encrypted world, however, I do not have standardized metrics
or benchmarks to measure. Data reporting is often inconsistent and incomplete,
making accurate comparisons between projects very difficult and often confusing the
most important content in practice[19]. In this thesis, I define basic terms, outline the
difficult challenges, and provide guidelines and key principles for evaluating
blockchain performance to keep inmind.
I propose two metrics: latency, and throughput. Performance indicators may
include the number of transactions per second or the median transaction confirmation
time. Latency is used to measure the speed of confirming individual transactions, and
throughput is used to measure the total rate of transactions over time. In the following
tests, I will measure the time from the first broadcast of the user's transaction to the
confirmation transaction as an indicator of the delay. Throughput measures the
17
number of transactions per second. The results of the comparison will be placed inthe
Table2

In the above comparison, my system is based on the alliance chain of
Hyperledger Fabirc, and adopts Kafka as my consensus mechanism. It was proposed
and implemented by the Apache Kafka project. The Kafka consensus mechanism is
mainly used in distributed systems, aiming to achieve high performance, high
scalability and fault tolerance[20]. Kafka consensus mechanism is not based on the
traditional consensus algorithm (such as Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm), but
through the partition and copy to achieve the consistency and fault tolerance of data.
It is widely used in log transmission, message queue, and event flow processing
scenarios in distributed systems, providing reliable data transmission and processing
power.
It's worth noting that Bitcoin's transactions are constructed based on its scripting
programming language called Script, which is not Turing-complete and based on a
stack-like data structure, which will lead to major performance issues with the Bitcoin
platform in subsequent tests.
Moreover, my system places a greater emphasis on resource tracing compared to
Ethereum and Bitcoin, as this aspect is of significant importance to users. All three
systems demonstratesatisfactory performance in query response time.
The following points further elaborate on the advantages of the system compared
toEthereum and Bitcoin:
a) The unique identifier system employed in my solution allows for more
efficient data management and retrieval, providing users with faster access to the
18
information they need.
b) The system’s focus on resource tracing ensures that users have better control
overtheir dataand can track its usage and modifications moreeffectively.
c) The integration of blockchain technology and smart contracts in my system
enhances its security, transparency, and trustworthiness, setting it apart from
Ethereum and Bitcoin.
d) The scalability of my system is superior to that of Bitcoin, as it is designed to
accommodate a growing number of users and data without compromising
performance orefficiency.
The system’s superior theoretical performance in identifier registration and
querying ensures that it can handle large volumes of data and user requests more
effectively than Ethereum and Bitcoin.
In conclusion, the proposed system demonstrates a more efficient and scalable
solution for data management and sharing when benchmarked against existing
systems like Ethereum and Bitcoin. By leveraging the advantages of unique identifier
pairs, resource tracing, and the integration of blockchain technology and smart
contracts, the system offers a robust and secure platform for users to manage and
share theirdata.

Bitcoin 764 1173 423 1891 988 712 1557 263 1412 847
I conducted tests on the maximum flow rate (number of transactions per second)
for each function and then executed these functions with varying flow rates. Table3
displays the response time of functions with varying transaction numbers per second
(i.e., throughput).It can be seen that my system delay mainly comes from the delay
caused by network fluctuations, concentrated in less than one second. Ethereum based
on the PoW consensus mechanism has less stable latency, compared to the PoS
consensus mechanism based latency of around 15 seconds, exactly when a block was
packaged in the Ethereum 2.0white paper. The Bitcoin has a less stabledelay because
it is also based on a consensus mechanism of PoW. In addition, I also performed
stress tests, which showed that the system can perform well under constant stress. In
contrast, the other two systems experienced network congestion. Based on my past
experiences, Ethereum, with its PoW consensus mechanism, even took up to 20
minutes to confirm a block during congestion. The reason behind this is Ethereum's
adoption of the Gas mechanism to limit the amount of content that can be included in
a block. When dealing with more complex content, a significant amount of Gas is
required for packaging, which easily leads to network congestion. On the other hand,
theperformance issuewith Bitcoin hasalready been mentioned earlier.
It can be seen that the performance advantages of my system mentioned earlier
primarily stem from the performance advantages of the consortium blockchain. A
consortium blockchain and a public blockchain are two different types of blockchain
networks. A consortium blockchain is suitable for scenarios that require establishing
trust and sharing data among restricted participants, whereas a public blockchain
offers advantages such as decentralization, security, and transparency. However, in
20
thecontext ofsmart manufacturing, participants in the blockchain share a certain level
of trust. Smart manufacturing involves multiple participants, including suppliers,
manufacturers, and logistics companies, who need to share and exchange data such as
supply chain information and production process data. A consortium blockchain can
providea secure and trustworthy platform for participants to share data whileensuring
transparency and traceability. Additionally, a consortium blockchain can improve the
efficiency and reliability of supply chain management[21]. Participants in the
manufacturing supply chain can share data such as orders, delivery status, and
inventory information on the consortium blockchain, enabling real-time visualization
and collaborative management of the supply chain. This reduces information
asymmetry and errors, enhancing overall supply chain efficiency and reliability.
Smart manufacturing typically involves a large number of Internet of Things (IoT)
devices and machines that require real-time communication and collaboration[22]. A
consortium blockchain can provide a distributed device management platform,
ensuring device authentication, data transmission security, and trusted interoperability
between devices. Furthermore, the adopted system also provides a platform for
deploying decentralized applications (chaincode). By combining these advantages and
mitigating some of the drawbacks of consortium blockchains, it is more suitable for
thesmart manufacturing scenario compared toa publicblockchain.
There are concerns among some individuals that the use of blockchains may lead
to a reduction in efficiency. To address these concerns, an experiment was conducted
to evaluate the impact of a blockchain-based system on the efficiency of retrieving
shared data stored across four Ali cloud servers. The experiment aimed to determine
whether the use of blockchain technology would result in any significant delays or
inefficiencies when accessing and sharing data. By measuring key performance
indicators such as response time and throughput, it was possible to assess the impact
of the blockchain-based system on overall efficiency. With inspirations of how to
perform blank control groups [23],I set up a blank control group that downloads data
using an SCP command from Linux with URL directly to learn about the system's
performance, and the other group obtains the URL of the system before downloading
21
the data with the SCP command. I repeated this experiment 10 times to reduce errors
caused by the network and each file is 1 MB in size. The results are shown in table 3.
It can be seen that the difference between the two groups is very small, and this
difference decreases as the number of files increases. The results of the experiment
indicate that in situations where the system throughput is high, file download latency
becomes a critical factor. However, since the data is stored across multiple Ali cloud
servers, it can be treated as a multi-cloud environment. This approach does not result
in any loss of performance and can actually improve efficiency by distributing the
workload across multiple servers.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the thesis proposes a novel identifier encoding and parsing system,
which is engineered to do so address the challenge of data sharing in multi-cloud
environments. The system makes use of namespace and identifier pairs to provide
readability and ease of use. The corresponding protocols for data registration,
updating, and parsing are also proposed. Benefits of the system are analyzed in a
comparison with existing systems, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, and the evaluation
results demonstrate that the proposed protocols are efficient and have minimal impact
on latency. The system can facilitate data sharing, improve supply chain management
efficiency, enable device management, and enhance data security in the context of
smart manufacturing. It is suitable for scenarios that require establishing trust and
sharing data among restricted participants. However, if the requirement is to build a
global open network, achieve higher decentralization that do not require high levels of
trust and interoperability, or have higher demands for performance and scalability,
then publicblockchains likeBitcoin may bemore suitablesolutions.
