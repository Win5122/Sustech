[Abstract]: In recent years, with the development of smart meter and
the promotion of green energy concepts, as well as the impact of the
energy crisis, people pay more attention to household electricity
consumption. Fine grained load prediction of household appliances will
help to plan household electricity plans reasonably, save energy, and
develop green and energy-saving smart homes. At the same time, accurate
power consumption prediction also provides reliable data and
decision-making support for the energy allocation task of smart home
energy management systems. More accurate power consumption
prediction also provides powerful reference indicators for power grid load
planning. However, due to the close correlation between electricity
consumption behavior and household life, residential electricity load
forecasting often faces issues such as limited data volume for individual
households and data privacy. In this paper, we use federated learning
technology to provide data privacy and data islanding solutions for
household electricity load forecasting. At the same time, when facing the
problem of different household electricity consumption behaviors and
different types of electrical appliances, we introduce federated mutual
learning methods to solve the problem of data heterogeneity and provide
personalized electricity consumption prediction models for different
3
households. We have also made certain improvements to the proposed
seq2seq-FML framework, such as introducing a global encoder model to
better extract features, and designing a dedicated linear layer for each
specific consumer during downstream prediction tasks. These
improvements have been proven effective in our ablation experiments.
Compared with traditional federated learning methods, the seq2seq-FML
framework proposed in this paper achieved approximately 5.04%
performance improvement.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
In recent years, with the development of smart meters and the promotion of
green energy concepts, as well as the impact of energy crises, people pay more
attention to household electricity consumption. Fine-grained household appliance load
forecasting will help to plan household electricity consumption reasonably, save
energy, develop smart homes that are green and energy-saving, and at the same time,
accurate power consumption prediction also provides reliable data and decision
support for the energy allocation task of the smart home energy management system
[10]. More accurate power consumption prediction also provides a powerful reference
index for power grid load planning [2]. However, due to the close relationship
between electricity consumption behavior and residents’ household life, household
electricity load prediction often faces the problem of small amount of data for
individual households and data privacy [26]. In practical applications, federated
learning can provide solutions to data privacy and data island problems for household
electricity load prediction, but it also faces the problem of different electricity
consumption behaviors and different types of appliances held by different households.
To solve the above problems, we hope to use the federated mutual learning [21]
method to solve the Data Heterogeneity and Objective Heterogeneity problems faced
by it.
1.2 Related Work
1.2.1 Smart home energy management system
Due to the huge impact of urban buildings [14], especially residential areas [1],
on energy consumption and emissions, research on smart home energy systems
[28][25] is constantly advancing. At the same time, in order to make HEMS [28] more
flexible in managing and controlling smart appliances, load forecasting of energy
8
consumption end and appliances is very important.
1.2.2 Household Electricity Forecasting
Compared to aggregated loads, load forecasting for individual consumers is
prone to non-stationary and stochastic features.[23] However, fine-grained load
forecasting can provide better suggestions for power scheduling. According to the
predicted time granularity, electricity consumption prediction can be divided into four
types: very short-term load forecasting (VSTLF), short-term load forecasting (STLF),
medium-term load forecasting (MTLF) and long-term load forecasting (LTLF)
[18][13][9], with corresponding usage scenarios at different time granularities. On the
other hand, different artificial intelligence models are used to predict future electricity
consumption based on historical energy usage data [18], such as CNN [12], LSTM
[23], and hybrid deep learning approach [4][19][3]. In this article, we mainly focus on
very short-term load forecasting (VSTLF) based on LSTM model.
1.2.3 Federated Learning
Household electricity data always faces privacy issues. Power companies
generally do not disclose their customers’ electricity usage information, and
customers are unwilling to share their electricity usage data because it would largely
reveal their behavioral information. Federated learning [16] is one way to solve this
problem and provide a powerful global model [22][7][5][20]. However, due to the
diversity of user behavior, the power consumption data for each client is not
independently and identically distributed, and it is necessary to personalize the model
for each client [15] [24][22].
1.3 Motivations and Contribution
The development of new energy technologies such as photovoltaics and wind
power has brought more clean energy to the world. However, due to the large impact
of uncertain factors such as the environment on these power generation methods,
9
more instability has also been introduced into the power system. In order to maintain
power supply balance, avoid damage to the power grid system caused by excessive
power generation, and ensure the electricity consumption needs of users, it is very
important to predict the production capacity of new energy electricity and the energy
consumption of the user side. Good power prediction will help power-related
departments better plan power allocation policies, balance power supply and demand,
and maintain stable operation of the power grid. In terms of electricity consumption at
the consumer end, fine-grained power consumption prediction at the level of electrical
appliances will also provide better guidance for HEMS [28]. However, in terms of
residential electricity consumption prediction, we often face problems such as data
privacy and highly personalized household electricity consumption behavior, which
makes it difficult to use a single model to describe. In order to solve the problems of
data privacy and model personalization in household energy consumption prediction,
we hope to use personalized federated learning to solve this problem. Fortunately, in
the field of computer vision, FML [21] frameworks have been proposed to solve
similar problems in image classification. The FML [21] framework combines
federated learning and DML [27] methods, using knowledge distillation technology to
further enhance the performance of personalized models. We hope to improve on this
framework by adjusting the DML [27] method and combining the LSTM model to
support personalized federated forecasting for household electricity load forecasting.
The key contributions of this paper are the following:
a) A unified framework for very short-term load prediction (VSTLF) of
household appliances has been established.
b) It solves problems such as low data volume and data privacy faced in
household level power consumption forecasting by using federated learning
technology.
c) The improved seq2seq-FML framework is used to personalize the prediction
of electricity consumption behavior in different households.

2. Personal Federated Learning for Load
2.1 Problem Definition
The load forecasting of household electrical appliances can be abstracted as a
typical time series forecasting problem.
For a specific household H, we observe the historical power consumption data of
its electrical appliances, and use this to predict the future power consumption of
electrical appliances. Specifically, the historical power consumption of electrical
appliances in a household can be expressed as 𝐴 = {(𝑝𝑡, 𝑝𝑡,… , 𝑝𝑡 ) | 𝑡 ∈
1 2 𝑚
[1,2,…,𝑇 ]}, where 𝑝𝑡 represents the power of the m-th selected consumer in the
𝑜𝑏𝑠 𝑚
household at time t, 𝑇 is the length of time observed. Similarly, we define the data
𝑜𝑏𝑠
to be predicted as 𝐵 = {(𝑝𝑡, 𝑝𝑡,… , 𝑝𝑡 ) | 𝑡 ∈ [𝑇 +1, 𝑇 + 2,…,𝑇 +
1 2 𝑚 𝑜𝑏𝑠 𝑜𝑏𝑠 𝑜𝑏𝑠
𝑇 ]} , 𝑇 is our predicted step size.
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑜𝑏𝑠
2.2 Framework
The overview of seq2seq FML Framework is given by (Figure 1). Overall, it
consists of two parts: local model and global model. Each family has its own local
model that utilizes local data for training, and the data used by users for training is not
shared with other families; The global model is a multi-family shared LSTM encoder.
11
Figure 1: The seq2seq FML Framework
Local model. For a specific family, its local model consists of two parts, Meme
model and personalized model, which have the same framework but different
parameters. Taking the Local model as an example, it consists of two parts, an
Encoder for feature extraction and a Decoder for prediction (Figure 2). The Encoder
uses the LSTM model, which can well capture the long-term and short-term
relationships in time series and convert the captured information into vectors output
from the hidden layer. Decoder will be more complex, consisting of LSTM and two
fully connected layers. The Meme model and the personalized model share the same
network structure, but do not share parameters. Besides, the Encoder part of the
Meme model is updated in collaboration with the global model, while the Decoder
part of the Meme model only plays a role in local training. The specific training
process in the local model will be given in the Loss section.
Global model. The global model plays a role in sharing information among
multiple families, and consists of an LSTM network. Note that the LSTM model here
is not an end-to-end prediction model, but an Encoder for feature extraction. Inspired
by semi supervised learning and large-scale pre training models, we believe that only
the Encoder part is shared, allowing it to learn on a larger dataset, then the extracted
12
features will be beneficial for downstream tasks (power consumption prediction). We
have also demonstrated through experiments that this design has better prediction
effects than directly sharing the end-to-end prediction models. Relevant experiments
are given in the experimental section.
Figure 2: Encoder and Decoder
2.3 Implementation Details
2.3.1 Training Process
The training process for seq2seq FML consists of two parts, local training, and
global training updates. Among them, local training uses the ideas in FML. We train
two models with the same structure to each other under a small knowledge gap.
Global training uses the fed-avg method to average the model parameters shared with
the global model in each local model and update the global model. The specific
parameter settings in the training will be given in the experiment section.

2.3.2 Loss Function
Knowledge distillation [8] is a common technique used for model compression,
and it also plays an important role in mutual learning. In our seq2seq-FML framework,
mutual learning also provided great contribution to load prediction. During the mutual
learning processing, the selection of knowledge distillation methods is very important
as it will help personalized models better learn the global knowledge brought by
meme models in fitting, thus obtaining personalized load prediction models with
stronger generalization.
In the target selection of knowledge distillation, there are generally two
approaches: hard target and soft target [11]. In the FML image classification task, the
author used the KL divergence between models as the Soft Target to train the model
for virtual learning. However, as a time series prediction problem, KL divergence
cannot well describe the gap between the two models. Based on this, we explore the
effect of using different targets (including soft target and hard target) and
corresponding loss function to conduct mutual learning. These loss functions are
given below.

models, respectively. 𝑂 and 𝑂 is the output of the two models during the training

In the selection of loss function, we choose MSE rather than the MAPE, which
commonly used in the prediction of total household power consumption [2]. This is
because at the level of household appliances, due to the randomness and short
duration of individual appliance usage, there are many 0 values or sustained low
power consumption values in training and prediction data (appliances not started or in
standby state). For such data, due to the small denominator, MAPE [2] cannot
accurately reflect the deviation between the predicted value and the true value of the
model, making it difficult for the model to converge. However, MSE loss can
effectively avoid such problems.
In order to select the best mutual learning loss that suitable for seq2seq-FML, we
constructed different 𝐿 to compare the impact of hard target and different soft
𝑚𝑢
target choices on model performance. These results will be given in the ablation
experiment section.

3. Experiments
In this section, we use real household appliance load data to conduct experiments
to verify the practicality of our proposed seq2seq-FML framework.
3.1 Experimental Settings
3.1.1 Experimental Environment
In our experiments, the hardware device used is a sever with NVIDIA Titan RTX
graphics cards. All programs are written based on Python 3.8 and pyTorch 11.2.
3.1.2 Dataset
The publicly available REFIT [17] dataset was used to test the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. This dataset contains electrical power consumption records
from 20 households in the UK over two years.
3.1.3 Data Pre-processing
Most of the data in REFIT [17] are sampled at 6-8 seconds intervals. In order to
obtain data that can be used for LSTM model training, we first eliminated the
obviously unreasonable data (the power of the distributor is greater than the total
power), filled in the latest effective power with a time interval of 1 second as the
minimum interval, and then resampled the data to obtain data with a time interval of
10 seconds and 1 minute, respectively. Before inputting the data into the model for
training, we also performed a min-max normalization process on the data. The final
predicted value of the model will be inversely normalized accordingly to obtain the
predicted power of the consumer in watts.
In the experiment, we selected three typical households from the REFIT [17], all
with typical household appliances from the UK (Fridge-Freezer, Washing Machine,
Dishwasher, Microwave, and Kettle). Considering the large amount of data as a
16
VSTLF problem, we selected data from one month in 2014 and data from six months
in 2014 to model the prediction problem for a 10s-time interval and a 1min time
interval, respectively.
3.1.4 Hyper-parameter
For all experiments conducting federated learning, we set the local training round
E=5, the federated training round R=10 (i.e., for a single model in a single family, the
total number of training rounds is E * R=50). The learning rate is 0.003. Batch size is
256. The ratio of training set, validation set, and test set is 6:2:2. The models validated
on the final test set are all the optimal models on the validation set.
For all non-federated learning methods, the total training rounds are set to
E*R=50, while other parameters are consistent with federated learning methods.
3.2 Baseline
In order to more intuitively demonstrate the difficulty of very short-term load
forecasting for household and the effect of our seq2seq-FML framework, we have
built the following baselines.
Naive model. This is the simplest intuitive prediction model, and we use this
naive model to calibrate the difficulty of predicting the power consumption of
household appliances. This simple model predicts future power consumption as
𝐵̂ = {(𝑝𝑇 𝑜𝑏𝑠,𝑝𝑇 𝑜𝑏𝑠,…,𝑝𝑇 𝑜𝑏𝑠)| 𝑡 ∈ [𝑇 +1,𝑇 +2,…,𝑇 +𝑇 ] }
1 2 𝑚 𝑜𝑏𝑠 𝑜𝑏𝑠 𝑜𝑏𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑
That is, the model predicts the power consumption of each consumer in the future
from 𝑇 +1 to 𝑇 as the same observation value of 𝑇 moment.
𝑜𝑏𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑜𝑏𝑠
Local LSTM model. This is a basic LSTM network consisting of an LSTM cell
and two fully connected layers (in order to maintain consistency with the model we
used in seq2seq FML). The hidden layer dimension is 128, and the dimensions of the
two linear layers are (128, 32) and (32,5), respectively.
17
Fed-avg. Based on the basic LSTM model, we used the fed-avg method
commonly used in federated learning to combine data from different households to
test the usefulness of federated learning methods in predicting household electrical
energy consumption. Specifically, the training process for fed-avg is as follows: Each
family (client) is now training a certain number of rounds E on the local dataset. After
the training for each family (client) is completed, the obtained model parameters will
be shared with the global model, averaged, and distributed to the models in each
family. This iteration involves a total of R rounds.
Figure 4: Model ablation experiment (MSE)
18
3.3 Experiments Result
Figure 4 gives the average MSE of all appliances in tested houses in time interval
of 1 min, 𝐿 = 99, 𝐿 = 6. We can see that our proposed method achieves
𝑜𝑏𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑
better performance than baselines under three designs. To more intuitively
demonstrate the effect of the model, we plot the percentage of performance
improvement in Figure 5 (based on Fed-avg).
3.4 Ablation Experiment
In this section, we hope to conduct some ablation experiments to verify the
effectiveness of the model while also attempting to further improve the model.
3.4.1 Hard Target and Soft Target
Here, we attempted to investigate the performance impact of different target
selection methods in knowledge distillation on the model. For Hard Target, we have
both the Meme model and the Personal model output predictions for future power
consumption 𝑂 and 𝑂 and use formula (5) to calculate 𝐿 . The result of MSE
𝑚 𝑝 𝑚𝑢
is given in (Figure 4, Fed-mu Hard-T).
On the other hand, for Soft Target, we have tried various soft target selection
methods. Firstly, we choose the hidden layer outputs of LSTM as the soft target to
train our model, because it contains the sequence information prior to its time point.
Specifically, we use the last hidden layer output 𝐻 and 𝐻 to calculate a
𝑚,𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡 𝑝,𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡
new 𝐿 as a part of the total loss function. The MSE result of this way is given in
𝑚𝑢
(Fed-mu Soft-T, Figure 4). We also tested collecting the hidden layer outputs
throughout the entire prediction process as soft target, but the effectiveness was not
significantly different from using the output of the last step directly, Fed-mu
Soft-T(list) (Figure 4). The selection of soft targets in Encoder-Decoder is vary
slightly due to changes in model structure, and will be explained in detail in the
19
following Encoder-Decoder section.
3.4.2 Encoder-Decoder
Encoder-Decoder [6] is a method of using a model to encode a sequence of
symbols into a fixed length vector representation, and then using another model to
decode this fixed length vector into the target symbol sequence. We hope to integrate
this technology into the seq2seq-FML model to obtain a better encoder for feature
extraction, while also enabling decoders in various households to better adapt to the
distribution characteristics of local data.
The Encoder-Decoder structure is shown in Figure 2. The change in the structure
of this model does not have a significant impact on the calculation of hard target loss.
We directly use the output of two FC layers in Decoder to calculate the 𝐿 by
𝑚𝑢
formula (3). However, for Soft Target, we design two new methods to calculate 𝐿 .
𝑚𝑢
In the first way, the hidden layer output from Decoder and the last observation data
are chosen as the Soft Target (red and yellow part in Figure 2), since the former
contains temporal information of the observed data, while the latter provides anchor
points for the current data values. Another method uses hidden layer information from
the previous moment (blue and yellow part in Figure 2), to avoid carrying too much
duplicate information in the output of the hidden layer, as the observed values in the
last step have already been used as part of the feature for calculating 𝐿 . The
𝑚𝑢
performance of these two methods is shown separately in the figure 4, ([En-De] Soft
𝑯 and [En-De] Soft 𝑯 ).

Figure 5: Model ablation experiment (%) (Base on Fed-avg)
3.4.3 Split Linear Layer Output.
During the visual analysis of the waveform predicted by the experiment, we
found that our model seems to have learned too much about the interaction between
different electrical appliances, but this seems to be false most of the time. To reduce
the tendency of our model, we decoupled the linear layer of the final output of our
model, which allowing each electrical appliance to have its own linear layer output.
Experiments have shown that this method achieves a slight performance improvement
on the existing basis, resulting in a total improvement of 5.0446% (Figure 5).
21
3.5 Result and Analyze
It can be seen, in Figure 4, the seq2seq FML framework has achieved a 2.1447%
improvement compared to the fed avg method. After adding the Encoder-Decoder
model, the performance has further improved to 4.7545%.
In Figure 4 and Figure 5, We also showed the results of using soft targets as the
mutual loss function. Although this attempt did not have a positive effect, even so,
comparing to add the Encoder-Decoder method, the performance achieved by the two
training methods has also been improved, which also proves that the
Encoder-Decoder structure that we designed can better predict the power consumption
of household appliances by sharing the Encoder to better extract features only.
In order to analyze the performance of the model in more detail, we compared
the performance of different household appliances on different models that have
improved performance on average (Figure 6). In the figure, we can see that in
different households, the prediction accuracy of these five types of electrical
appliances has mostly improved, and the former three types (Fridge-Freezer, Washing
Machine, Dishwasher) are dominated. This may be due to the better periodicity and
longer usage time of the first three types of electrical appliances, which means that
their electrical characteristics will be better captured in the same time span of data.
For the latter two types of electrical appliances, their use may be more random and
have a shorter duration, but our model has also achieved some results.
In addition, we have noticed that in House 5, all the three models have had
opposite effects in predicting washing machines and microwave ovens. It is
preliminarily suspected that the low frequency of use of these two types of electrical
appliances in the household has resulted in the loss of too much effective information
in our model during the personalization process, or made it difficult for local decoders
to learn the mapping characteristics of these two types of electrical appliances,
However, further experiments are still needed to prove this.

4 Conclusion
This paper studies the personalized load forecasting problem of household
appliances, revealing a series of challenges and providing a new solution for load
forecasting at the appliance level.
First, the federal learning mode is used to train the power consumption data of a
variety of electrical appliances from different families, which to a large extent ensures
the privacy and safety of users. In the context of the popularity of smart meter, it is
possible to promote the power consumption prediction technology on a large scale.
Secondly, in response to the common problem of data heterogeneity in federated
learning, we introduced the FML framework, which utilizes mutual learning between
two models in local models to better adapt the local personalized
model to the local data distribution and achieve better prediction results. At the
same time, a special adaptation has been made to the time series prediction problem,
proposing a seq2seq-FML framework suitable for predicting the power consumption
of multiple households and appliances.
Finally, we conducted extensive ablation experiments on the seq2seq-FML
model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Encoder Decoder structure and the
Hard-Target knowledge distillation method in this model. We also fine-tuned the
model structure to improve its prediction accuracy on test data by approximately 5.04%
compared to the traditional Fed-avg method.
25
5 Shortcomings and Future Work
Despite achieving these results, the robustness and generalization of the model
still need to be tested on larger datasets due to limitations in dataset size. In addition,
in the future, we also hope to explore the performance under unbalanced tasks, such
as the effectiveness of the seq2seq model in different households with different
electrical appliances, or further improve the model to not only provide better
personalized performance in data distribution but also in user usage.
