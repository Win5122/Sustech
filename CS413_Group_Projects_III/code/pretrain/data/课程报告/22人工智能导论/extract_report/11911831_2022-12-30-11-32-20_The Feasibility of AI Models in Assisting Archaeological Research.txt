I. I NTRODUCTION
In recent years, artificial intelligence has been developed
and popularized in many fields. It has also been rapidly pop-
ularized and applied in archaeology, promoting the efficiency
of archaeological work in some relevant fields, such as using
pattern recognition cultural relics restoration, using computer
vision technology in archaeological exploration, inferencing
ancient characters with deep learning and so on. In this journal,
we will focus on trying to use several AI models to identify
different kinds of jade according to their unique feature like
spectral, mineral, crystal characteristics.
II. A PPLICABILITY OF JADE IDENTIFICATION WITH AI
A. Background Survey
Since the 1980s, with some Breakthroughs in Chinese
archaeology research, a great amount of jade which was exca-
vated need to be accurately classified and detected with some
jade’s details. With the requirement of relevant knowledge and
experience, this kind of jobs can be very overwhelming and
challenging for archaeology researchers.
Also in these day, many provinces in China have witnessed
an upsurge in the manufacture of fake antiques, and the
manufacture of fake ancient jade is one of these phenomenon.
By using the current modern production technology, the im-
itation of ancient jade can be extremely high, even people
can not tell them accurately. Antique jade made in different
regions can be imitated in various ways. The manufacture of
modern antique jade is closely related to the development of
archaeological discoveries and ancient jade identification, and
many archaeological research achievements have been used
for reference.
Over the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has become
widespread across science and technology. With the develop-
ment of Machine Learning, nowadays it can be convenient
and efficiently to apply several AI models not only to helparchaeology researchers by working jade identification, but
also to help people identify different kinds of jade without
being cheated.
B. Application Cases
When it comes to the topic of cultural relics identification,
we can found there exists many AI models applications
in these relevant fields, such as pottery identification, rock
geological identification and jade identification. To extend
our ideas on this topic, we do some research on relevant
cultural relics identification’s topic. And We will discuss some
common cultural relics identification methods by using some
cases we research as below.
•Automatic Recognition of Pottery with DNN
The ArchAIDE project raised by italian archaeology
researchers mainly use two different deep neural networks
to dedicate image recognition and shape recognition. This
project basically use pipeline framework to implement the
application, using two kinds of classifiers: Appaerence-
based recognition classifier and Shaped-based recognition
classifier to handle the input image information. Once
these images can be identified into correct type, the result
can be linked to the photographed sherd and stored in
databases which can be accessed online. For studying this
case, we find a new idea to identify jade: classification
with DNN.

recognition from an input image to results.
•Intelligent Mineral Identification with Spectral Analysis
Considering ancient jade is a special kind of minerals,
hence we focus on researching some study about mineralanalysis. In the field of Mineral Identification, Ameri-
can scientist Lopez-Reyes established three mathemati-
cal models of multivariate analysis based on principal
component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS)
and artificial neural networks (ANNs), and propose a
similarity learning method based on Siamese network,
which classification accuracy reaches 0.94 in Raman
Minerals Test. Its main idea is to analyze the spectral
data of minerals under different light and the size of
mineral suspended particles, which help us realize how to
accurately identify the types of minerals including jade.
C. Limitation of Jade Identification with AI models
•Huge Gap between Ancient Jade Recognition and AI
The meaning of related minerals in ancient jade recogni-
tion can be qualitatively and clearly described, while ma-
chine learning is based on data, and the recognition pro-
cess and standards are often difficult to explain directly.
How to overcome the differences between these two
aspects has become the biggest obstacle for researchers
of different majors to conduct cross research.
•Lack of Jade Identification Data Sets
There exists a shortage of ancient jade related data
sets. Benchmark data sets play an important role in the
research and innovation of ancient jade identification.
Benchmark datasets based on high-quality and big data
can build better discriminant models and support strict
performance comparisons.
•Early Stage In Archaeology Application with AI
Machine learning method is still in the early stage of
exploration in ancient jade recognition, especially in
mineral intelligent recognition, and lacks mature methods
that are widely recognized, highly accurate and fast. The
existing methods are usually used for scattered datasets
of different objects and methods. The author sets his own
standards to evaluate the performance in the absence of
standard answers, which makes it difficult to accurately
compare the detection performance, advantages and dis-
advantages of each method, thus hindering the application
and change of the latest detection methods;
•High Development Cost and Uncertain Quality
On the one hand, AI Archaeology Application’s de-
velopment cost can be high, as well as the AI model
development’s quality can be uncertain, which means the
high development cost of the ancient jade identification
project with the low efficiency, leading to difficulty to
carry out large-scale application. On the other hand, due
to the specificity of cultural relics, it is difficult for
such solutions to generate a universal solution, which
may require developers to frequently adjust the relevant
parameters of the model to reach the standard of the
actual situation.
III. M ACHINE LEARNING IN JADE IDENTIFICATION
To test what we have learnt in a more directed approach, we
implement several AI models in Jade identification to explainthe theoretical ideas in practical example.
We choose jade as the research object for the following
reasons. Firstly, jade has been a long-lasting symbol for
ancient China. There is a famous jade story dates back to
the Warring States Period, when the Qin king offered 15
towns to the state of Zhao in exchange of the rare treasure
’He Shi Bi’. We could easily tell how important it is for
ancient people as a connection bond and socializing symbol.
The inheritance of jade has been passed down to this day.
Jade often represents as a family heirloom to witness the
rise and fall of a family, the family members’ spirit and
emotion, cohesion of the family strength. The inheritance
of jade often carries the ancestors’ expectations for future
generations, hoping that future generations can become a
person with faith, pursuit and gentle as jade stands for. While
the specific way of using jade and its social significance vary
greatly in different cultures, social circumstance and historical
stages. The awareness, recognition, use and respectfulness of
ancestors for jade are directly related to the physical properties
of jade and the social value as well as cultural connotation
endowed by the physical properties. Nephrite’s unique high
toughness may be used to embody and construct the character
and social relationship with life vigor, lasting, eternal and
unbreakable. The high toughness determines that jade can be
used for a long life, so a piece of jade can be passed down
from generation to generation, while its physical properties
remain basically unchanged. This is also an important reason
for nephrite to be studied in archaeology. The toughness of
nephrite is determined by the properties of the fiber bundles
themselves and the intersection between fiber bundles. The
smaller single crystals that compose fiber bundles, the greater
degree of dislocation between the crystals, and hence greater
strength of fiber bundles. To put it in a nut shell, the smaller the
fiber bundle, the higher the degree of interweaving, the higher
the toughness of nephrite which leads to a higher density
and better stability. It is the particularity of fiber structure of
nephrite that determines the special high toughness and density
of nephrite, and then the special warm luster of nephrite, which
together constitute the special texture of nephrite.
The structural composition of nephrite is tremolite-
actinolite, that is, mineral type with chemical formula
Ca2(Mg,Fe)5Si8O22(OH)2. In order to analyze the structural
components of jade on the basis of protecting the cultural relics
themselves, we adopt the non-destructive mineralogy analysis
method of jade, that is, to scan the jade in an all-round way
through the spectral scanner, and obtain a set of spectral data
of the jade.
Different bands contain different chemical element infor-
mation. We can identify whether an artifact is nephrite or not,
and whether it has been incinerated or not by judging the
characteristics of different bands.
The data used for processing is a group of spectral data files
in.mat format. There are two dimensions in the file: the jade
number corresponding to each spectral data, and the spectral
data obtained at the frequency of 1300nm-2500nm at the
sampling rate of 2nm, which is represented by the reflectancesize at the corresponding frequency.
In addition, we manually marked the jade data through the
jade characteristic labels prepared by the archaeologists pro-
vided by the Humanities and Social Sciences Center. Among
them, the mineral composition is analyzed by near infrared
spectroscopy: Np-i-nephrite Type I, NP-II-nephrite Type II, Np
III nephrite Type III, AT-leaf serpentine, CT-chlorite, IT-illite,
DC-Dicarkite, QZ-chalcedony, cryptocrystalline quartz, UN-
unknown mineral or rock. The other characteristics, degree
of sensitivity, and texture classification of objects include: A
- objects whose mineral composition is Np I; The mineral
composition of B, B1, B2 - is similar to that of A, is Np I,
but contains trace vermiculite, B - has no or weak exposure
or secondary changes (not including type A type I jade pipe),
B1 - moderate or strong exposure or secondary changes (not
including type A type I jade pipe), B2-A type I jade tube,
no or weak qinling or secondary changes; C-A type I jade
pipe, mineral composition is Np II; D - objects with mineral
composition of Np III; S - Minerals or rocks not jade.
We used Extra Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine
(SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes and K Neighbors to distinguish
the spectral data features of jade and non-jade.
A. Extra Tree Classifier
Extra Tree Classifier is a tree-based ensemble machine
learning algorithm that is used for classification tasks. It is
an extension of the decision tree algorithm and is often used
as a substitute for random forests, which are another type
of tree-based ensemble algorithm. It works by building a
set of decision trees on a subset of the training data and
then combining the predictions of these trees to make a final
prediction. Each tree in the ensemble is trained on a different
subset of the training data, and the predictions of all the trees
are combined using a majority vote or an averaging method.
And it is known for its fast training speed and high accuracy,
especially for datasets with a large number of features. It is
also resistant to overfitting, which means that it is able to
generalize well to unseen data. However, it is not as robust to
noisy or imbalanced data as some other algorithms.
B. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised
machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and
regression tasks. They work by finding a hyperplane in a high-
dimensional space that maximally separates different classes.
They are known for high accuracy and ability to handle high-
dimensional data. They are particularly useful for datasets with
a large number of features or when the relationships between
features are complex. SVMs are also resistant to overfitting,
which means that they are able to generalize well to unseen
data. However, SVMs can be sensitive to the choice of kernel
function and require careful tuning of hyperparameters to
achieve good performance. They can also be computationally
expensive to train, especially for large datasets.C. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a type of instance-based
learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression
tasks. It works by storing all the training data and then
predicting the label or value for a new sample by finding
the K nearest neighbors in the training data and using their
labels or values to make a prediction. It is a simple and
intuitive algorithm that is easy to understand and implement.
It requires no training and can be used for both classification
and regression tasks. However, KNN can be computationally
expensive to use, especially for large datasets, and it is
sensitive to the choice of K and the distance metric used to
measure similarity between samples.
D. Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a type of probabilistic machine learning
algorithm that is used for classification tasks. It is based on
the Bayes theorem, which states that the probability of an
event occurring is equal to the prior probability of the event
multiplied by the likelihood of the event given some evidence.
In the context of classification, Naive Bayes works by using
the probabilities of different classes and the probabilities of
different features given each class to predict the class for a new
sample. It is called ”naive” because it makes the assumption
that all the features in the data are independent, which is often
not the case in real-world data. Despite this assumption, Naive
Bayes is often surprisingly effective and is widely used in a
variety of applications. It is simple to implement and requires
relatively little training data. However, it can be sensitive to
the presence of correlated features and may not perform as
well as other algorithms for more complex datasets.
E. Experiments
The following is the confusion matrix of the results of
mineral composition classification:

Fig. 5. Gaussian Naive Bayes
According to the confusion matrix and score of the su-
pervised learning classification results of the above minerals,
SVM can give better classification results in this case, while
the Extra Tree Classifier is unstable, with the dominant re-
sult exceeding 0.88 and sometimes lower than 0.85, and K
Neighbors slightly lower than the first two. However, Gaussian
NB has poor classification effect, this is due to the limits
when using Gaussian NB, it requires the datasets’ features
are independent as we explained above. However, the datawe obtained from Jade has 600 features, even though we use
feature extraction to reduce it to 50 features, they are still not
independent. We can tell from the figure below, for a feature -
OH, it is represented by 1380nm-1420nm. Hence, even though
we reduced features in jade datasets, the features are still not
independent which leads to bad performance of Gaussian NB.
