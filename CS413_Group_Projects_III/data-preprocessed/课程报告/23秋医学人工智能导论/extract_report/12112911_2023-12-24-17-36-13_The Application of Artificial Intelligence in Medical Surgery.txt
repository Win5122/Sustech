 Ⅰ. Introductio n 
Medical surgery, as an integral part of healthcare practice, has undergone a long 
and illustrious developmental journey. From primitive attempts in the early stages to 
today's high -tech advancements, the evolution of the field of surgery has not only 
witne ssed a profound understanding of anatomy but also reflected continuous 
innovation in medical technology. In ancient times, surgical procedures were primarily 
based on experience and practical knowledge, lacking systematic anatomical 
understanding. The civi lizations of ancient Egypt and Greece laid the groundwork for 
the development of surgery, but procedures remained perilous and rudimentary. Over 
centuries, ancient surgeons accumulated rich experiences through practices in both 
wartime and peacetime.  
With the advent of the Renaissance, the rise of anatomy injected new vitality into 
the development of surgery. Pioneering anatomists like Leonardo da Vinci and Vesalius 
conducted in -depth studies of the human body, providing a more systematic and 
scientific foundation for surgical procedures. Discoveries during this period 
significantly enhanced the precision and safety of surgery. The 20th century witnessed 
technological leaps in surgery, including the invention of hemostatic instruments, the 
introduction of aseptic techniques, and advancements in anesthesia. The development 
of these three major technologies greatly improved the success rate of surgeries and 
patient survival, transforming surgery into a refined and c omplex medical specialty.  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves the programming simulation of human 
intelligence, mimicking human behaviors such as learning, reasoning, and perception. 
AI is the intelligence of machines and electronics, with robots acting as active agents 
in the ph ysical world. The goal of AI technology is to design programs capable of 
making decisions on their own and executing tasks with higher efficiency and fewer 
medical errors (Hashimoto et al., 2018) . The research fields of AI encompass machine 
learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, expert systems, 
and more. AI applications have permeated various sectors, including healthcare, finance, 
education, transportation, and bey ond. In the medical field, AI is utilized for tasks such as medical imaging diagnosis, disease prediction, drug development, surgical 
treatments, providing powerful tools to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.  
In 1985, neurosurgeons performed stereotactic surgery with the assistance of 
industrial robots, marking the first integration of robotics and surgery (Bargar, 2007) . 
After decades of rapid development, AI has made significant progress in healthcare, 
and medical robots have gained wide recognition in fields such as cardiac surgery, 
orthopedics, gastrointestinal surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, and others, showing 
promi sing results (Advincula, 2006; Lang et al., 2011) . Medical robots can be used to 
precisely locate lesions during surgery and assist in holding and stabilizing surgical 
instruments. The combination of AI and medical surgery also enables real -time 
monitoring of patients' physiological indicators and surgic al progress, providing 
personalized treatment plans and delivering safer, more precise, and individualized 
medical services to patients. Additionally, it provides powerful tools and support for 
doctors, reducing the learning curve and propelling the field of surgery into a new era.  
 
Ⅱ. Intelligen t surgical assistance system  
Robot -assisted surgery  
With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and robotic technology, robot -
assisted surgical systems have gradually become a disruptive technology in the field of 
surgery. Their superiority lies not only in improving the precision of surgical oper ations 
but also in providing surgeons with more means of manipulation and richer feedback 
information.  Some  of the medical robot s have been used into practice  (Figure 1).   
Figure 1.  The series of medical robot  
Robot -assisted surgical systems, through advanced mechanical structures and 
sophisticated sensor technology, translate the manual operations of surgeons into highly 
precise robotic movements (Medical Image Computing and Computer -Assisted 
Intervention – MICCAI 2016 , 2016) . This not only makes minimally invasive surgery 
more feasible, reducing patient surgical trauma, but also lowers the risk of surgical 
complications. The stability and precision of robots enable surgeons to better handle 
minute anatomical structures, there by increasing the success rate of surgeries.   
The robot arm in the  rπ Tech laboratory of Academician Meng Qinghu, director of the 
Department of Electronics of Southern University of Science and Technology, has 
planned the path of knee replacement surgery, and the efficiency and accuracy of the 
doctor's knee surgery can be well gu aranteed by using the robot.  (Figure 2).  
 
Figure 2.  The knee replacement surgery robot  arm (from the  the rπ Tech laboratory ). 
However, not all surgeons believe that robot -assisted procedures can have a 
positive impact on the surgical process. After discussions with several surgeons in the 
field, it was found that older and more experienced surgeons tend to believe that robotic 
assistance in surgery may not contribute to the progress of the procedure,  some surgeons 
argue that for a group with high proficiency in surgical skills and related theoretical 
foundations, learning and practically using a completely new robotic system as surgical 
assistance may hinder the progress of the surgery and lead to del ays in the connection 
of various surgical components.  
In contrast, among younger doctors, the evaluation of the use of medical surgical 
robots is generally positive. They believe that for a group of doctors with less clinical 
surgical practice experience, the intervention of medical robots can to some extent 
compensate for the gap caused by lack of experience between younger and more 
experienced doctors. After learning and using the robot, there is a noticeable 
improvement in the speed, success rate, and accuracy of the surgery compared to 
procedures performed  without robotic assistance. In robot -assisted surgery, surgeons 
manipulate the robotic arms through a console. During this process, the system provides 
real-time visual feedback and perceptual information, allowing surgeons to have a more 
intuitive unders tanding of the surgical area (Goldberg & Falcone, 2003) . The high -
resolution cameras and three -dimensional imaging technology of the robotic system 
offer surgeons a comprehensive and clear surgical scene, enabling them to closely 
observe minute structures and make more informed decisions. Although there is 
insufficient r esearch data to conclusively support these perspectives, the varied 
opinions from different age groups of doctors provide a dialectical view for our 
exploration of the integration of robots and surgical procedures in this project.  
As some doctors have pointed out, robot -assisted surgery demonstrates remarkable 
performance in handling complex procedures (Gucer et al., 2018; Mäenpää et al., 2015; 
Medical Image Computing and Computer -Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 2016 , 2016)  
such as cardiac surgery and neurosurgery. In fields that require high precision and 
meticulous operations, robotic systems can serve as valuable assistants to surgeons. The 
programmability and multiple degrees of freedom of the robotic arms make it easier  to 
perform intricate maneuvers within the constraints of limited surgical spaces. 
Nowadays, medical surgical robots have gained a certain level of popularity and 
acceptance (Moustris et al., 2011) . After visiting hospitals and attending presentations 
by relevant professors, we have observed that in some medical institutions, a relatively 
mature application system for surgical robots has been established （Figure 3）. 
 
Figure 3. The application of robot in surgery (from Southern University of Science and 
Technology Hospital)  
In spinal surgery, a robot with tracking imaging capabilities provides real -time 
images to the surgeon. The surgeon formulates relevant medical plans and interacts with 
the surgical robot to carry out the operation. The interaction between the surgeon and 
the surgical robot, along with the image delivery function of tracking images, 
significantly enhances the precision and success rate of the surgery (Goldberg & 
Falcone, 2003) . 
 
Figure 4. The O -arm assisted Tianji robotic surgery (from Southern University of Science 
and Technology Hospital)  
At the Southern University of Science and Technology Hospital, we encountered a 
medical surgical robot with an "O" -shaped arm （Figure 4）. Recently, the hospital's 
orthopedic team successfully completed the first national surgery assisted by the O -
shaped arm Tianji robot, showcasing the feasibility and superiority of combining 
artificial intelligence with surgical procedures. In addition, i nformation from the 
lectures of relevant professors revealed that surgical robots can effectively reduce the 
area of some  surgical incisions, achieving the goal of minimally invasive procedures. 
This minimizes patient discomfort, enhances the overall medical and treatment 
experience for patients. With the assistance of the robot, the implantation of bone 
screws in the patient's body requires only a minimally invasive procedure on the 
wrist (Figure 5) , significantly reducing the size of the incision compared to traditional 
methods. This reduction lowers the risk of postoperative complications and elevates the 
overall healthcare experience for patients.

Science and Technology Hospital)  
The latest research in the integration of robotics and surgical medical practices 
provides a deeper understanding and outlines cutting -edge trends in the field. The 
current research focus is primarily on the intelligence of robotic systems and the 
enhancem ent of surgical procedures through virtual reality. For instance, some studies 
are dedicated to leveraging deep learning and machine learning technologies to enable 
robotic systems to better adapt to the anatomical structures of different patients, thereby  
improving the effectiveness of personalized surgeries.  
On the other hand, the integration of virtual reality and augmented reality 
technologies with robot -assisted surgeries is also a current research hotspot. This fusion 
provides surgeons with a more immersive surgical experience and offers additional 
informa tion support for surgical planning and implementation. These research 
achievements lay a solid foundation for the future development of intelligent -assisted 
surgical systems, promising more innovations and breakthroughs in the field of surgery.  
 
Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality -Driven Surgical 
Navigation Systems  
In the evolution of surgical procedures, the significant transformation brought 
about by artificial intelligence and augmented reality technologies has revolutionized 
the development of surgical navigation systems. Particularly, medical navigation 
systems based on artificial intelligence and augmented reality have become a hot focus 
in the recent integration of artificial intelligence and medical surgery.  
Traditional surgical procedures face challenges in meeting the demands of modern 
precision surgery, and the rapid advancement of modern medical imaging technology 
and medical robotics provides robust support for the emergence of intelligent 
navigation syst ems. Among them, surgical navigation systems accurately correlate 
preoperative or intraoperative medical images with the patient's anatomical 
structures (Medical Image Computing and Computer -Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 
2016 , 2016) .They track the real -time position of surgical instruments within the 
patient's body and display it in the form of a virtual probe, offering surgeons a clearer 
and more intuitive surgical field.  
To reduce surgical trauma, shorten surgery duration, and enhance surgical quality, 
computer -assisted surgical navigation systems have gradually found application in 
clinical practice. Initially, the system reconstructs human anatomy based on 
preoperative C T or MRI images. Surgeons then determine the actual structure of the 
surgical area and the required positions using the system. Finally, the system's motion 
analysis guides surgeons through the surgery, making it faster, more precise, and safer.  
With the development of artificial intelligence technology, artificial intelligence is 
gradually integrated into computer -assisted surgical navigation systems. AI -based 
computer -assisted surgical navigation systems have become a research hotspot, 
covering aspects such as image data collection, image processing, surgical planning, 
spatial localization and system registration, as well as surgical navigation ("<Artificial 
Intelligence and Robotics.pdf>,") . By incorporating extensive patient data and expert 
knowledge, artificial intelligence enables the system to learn medical knowledge from 
expert doctors, simulate their thinking and diagnostic reasoning, providing doctors with 
more reliable diagnostic res ults and surgical plans.  
Mixed reality technology also demonstrates significant potential in the field of 
cross -regional consultations. By integrating elements of virtual reality (VR) and 
augmented reality (AR), mixed reality technology provides doctors with an unprecedented interactive experience, eliminating geographical distance as a limitation 
for medical collaboration and consultations.  
With the support of mixed reality technology, doctors can achieve real -time cross -
regional consultations in a virtual medical consultation room. By wearing virtual reality 
headsets, doctors can collectively observe patients' medical images, case data, and 
virtual patient anatomical structures. This interactive environment makes doctors feel 
as if they are in the same location, enabling collaborative discussions, analysis of patient 
situations, and the provision of more comprehensive and accurate medical opi nions. 
For surgical procedures, mixed reality technology can also provide remote surgical 
support. Surgeons can remotely guide surgeries through mixed reality platforms, 
observe the surgical scene, jointly formulate surgical plans, and facilitate collabora tive 
work across different regions (Figure 6). 
 
Figure 6. The Cross -Regional Consultation  achieved by MR  
Furthermore, mixed reality technology offers new possibilities for medical training 
and education. Medical students can engage in practical exercises and simulated 
surgeries in a virtual environment, gaining a more realistic training experience and 
enhanci ng their skill levels.  
Through mixed reality technology, medical teams can achieve real -time, immersive 
cross -regional consultations and collaboration, effectively overcoming geographical 
barriers and improving the efficiency and quality of healthcare services. The continuous 
innovation and application of this technology are expected to bring about more 
breakthroughs and improvements in the field of medicine.  
Another application of mixed reality technology is the overlay of real -time medical 
images. Doctors can use augmented reality (AR) technology to overlay a patient's real -
time medical images onto their body, allowing doctors to intuitively observe internal 
structures on the patient's body surface, thereby enhancing understanding of the 
patient's condition. In the surgical navigation process, augmented reality (AR) 
technology and mixed reality (MR) technology are widely applied. AR technology 
calculates the p osition and angle of the camera image in real -time and adds the 
corresponding image to the camera image, providing surgeons with a real -time, 
precisely matched field of view. This enables doctors to quickly and accurately locate 
the patient's position and surgical needs, thereby improving the efficiency and success 
rate of the surgery. Through interviews with surgeons and observing specific 
operational demonstrations, we found that in practical applications, augmented reality 
technology can be used for preo perative surgical planning simulations, allowing for a 
pre-rehearsal of the surgery before it starts, thus enhancing the success rate. It can also 
magnify deep human anatomical structures during surgery, facilitating surgeons in 
comprehensive positioning and observation of adjacent and surgical areas (Figure 7).

Technology Hospital)  
 
Automated Surgical Planning and Execution  
With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent 
surgical planning, a crucial component of surgical procedures, has introduced more 
sophisticated and personalized planning and execution to significantly enhance the 
efficiency a nd quality of surgeries. This innovation not only personalizes surgical paths 
but also, through the integration of extensive patient data and machine learning 
algorithms, provides optimal treatment plans for surgeons, achieving the goal of 
precision medici ne. 
In intelligent surgical planning, artificial intelligence systems analyze patients' 
medical images, clinical data, and personalized health information to tailor 
individualized surgical paths. The advantages of such personalized planning include 
minimizing surgical risks and enhancing the overall safety of surgeries. Through deep 
learning and algorithm optimization, the system can offer unique treatment strategies 
for different cases, providing surgeons with more precise and reliable planning 
foundations (Ryu et al., 2017) . 
Moreover, artificial intelligence plays a role in supporting decision -making and 
optimizing paths in surgical procedures. By integrating vast clinical data and medical 
knowledge, the system can monitor real -time changes during surgery, offering surgeons 
immediate feedback and decision support. This real -time analytical capability enables 
quick adjustments to surgical strategies, improving decision accuracy and maintaining 
high levels of confidence throughout the entire surgical process.  
In real clinical surgeries, some advanced systems integrate robotic technology to 
achieve automatic control of surgical instruments (Chen & Asch, 2017) . This means that 
robots can perform a series of precise actions during surgery, reducing human errors. 
Additionally, automated control helps shorten surgical duration, enhance medical 
efficiency, and prevent resource wastage. The development of automated surgical 
execution will bring a higher level of precision and efficiency to surgical procedures, 
providing patients with a safer and more reliable treatment experience.  
 
Ⅲ. Technical difficulties  
In the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into applications within the medical 
field, we face a series of complex technological challenges. Firstly, the issue of data 
quality and annotation poses a significant bottleneck.  
Data annotation is crucial for enabling AI to learn from collected data by enriching 
it with additional knowledge. The most common forms of annotation include 
classification (e.g., which organs are visible in an image), semantic segmentation (e.g., 
which p ixels belong to which organ in an image), and numerical regression (e.g., the 
size of an object). The complexity and heterogeneity of medical data introduce 
uncertainties in its quality, including potential missing, erroneous, or inconsistent data. 
This no t only affects the reliability of the data but also has a direct impact on the training 
and performance of AI models. Additionally, the annotation process is often time -
consuming and requires expert knowledge, making it a high -cost endeavor. The 
subjectivi ty of annotations is also a significant challenge, as interpretations of medical 
images or texts may vary among different healthcare professionals (Bodenstedt et al., 2020) . 
Secondly, the issue of model interpretability becomes particularly crucial. Despite 
the significant achievements of deep learning models in handling medical data, their 
opacity makes the decision -making process challenging to interpret (Liang et al., 2021) . 
In the medical environment, transparency of AI decisions is paramount, and patients 
and healthcare professionals need to understand how the model arrives at specific 
conclusions. Enhancing model interpretability not only increases patients' trust in 
medi cal decisions but also helps healthcare professionals better understand and accept 
AI recommendations.  
On the other hand, algorithmic robustness is also a prominent concern. The 
complexity and uncertainty in the medical field require algorithms to possess strong 
robustness, maintaining accuracy in the face of different disease variations, clinical 
practices , and equipment differences. Algorithms need resilience against uncertainties 
such as noise, variations in image quality, etc., to ensure reliability in real medical 
scenarios. Therefore, how to maintain the robustness of AI algorithms in complex and 
dynam ic medical environments remains a challenging technical problem that requires 
in-depth research.  
In overcoming these technical challenges, collaborative efforts among medical 
professionals, computer scientists, data scientists, and legal experts are necessary. 
Technological innovation, improvement in data standardization, and the establishment 
and adh erence to regulations will provide a solid foundation for the development of 
medical AI, leading to more accurate, interpretable, and robust applications.  
 
Ⅳ. Moral and ethical issues  
With the vigorous development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, its 
application in the field of medical surgery has raised a series of profound ethical issues. 
Among them, data privacy and responsibility, along with legal issues, emerge as the 
most prominent focal points. In medical surgery, AI systems require extensive sensitive 
medical information from patients, including medical records, surgical histories, and imaging data. However, the highly sensitive and private nature of this data makes 
balancing medical technological innovation with the protection of patient privacy a 
complex and urgent task.  
One primary challenge is ensuring the privacy of patient data. Medical information 
involves extremely private content such as a patient's health condition and medical 
history, necessitating measures to prevent unauthorized access and potential data 
breache s. In the context of data sharing, ensuring that data is not misused or accessed 
by unauthorized third parties is a highly complex issue. Additionally, informed consent 
from patients is a crucial aspect of protecting data privacy. Patients need to have a c lear 
understanding of how their data will be used for AI system training and application, and 
they should provide fully informed consent (Collins et al., 2022) . Simultaneously, 
regulations need to ensure that patient privacy is adequately protected during the 
informed consent process to prevent data misuse. Furthermore, anonymization and de -
identification serve as means to address privacy issues, but their imple mentation is not 
without challenges. Anonymizing medical data does not absolutely protect against 
reidentification, requiring a delicate balance between anonymization and data quality.  
Another focal issue, responsibility, and legal problems come to the forefront when 
AI systems provide decision -making or assistance in medical surgery. It is imperative 
for doctors and medical institutions to clearly define their legal responsibilities whe n 
using AI technology. Determining the boundaries of responsibility between doctors and 
AI systems, as well as tracing responsibility in case of issues, are pressing matters that 
need resolution (Cobianchi et al., 2022) . 
In addition to the key issues mentioned above, other ethical concerns in the 
application of AI in medical surgery include transparency and interpretability, fairness, 
and bias (Moglia et al., 2021) . Addressing these ethical issues requires collaborative 
efforts from various stakeholders, including medical institutions, technology companies, 
and regulatory bodies. Clear regulations and ethical guidance, transparent informed 
consent procedures, and te chnologically sound data security measures are all necessary 
means to safeguard patient privacy. Only within a framework of clear legal regulations 
and ethical standards can the integration of AI with medical surgery better propel advancements in the medical field while simultaneously protecting patient rights (Yu et 
al., 2018) . 
 
Ⅴ. Discussion  
We had the privilege of engaging in a conversation with Dr. Wang Lin, the Chief 
of Spinal Surgery at the Southern University of Science and Technology Hospital, who 
holds the distinction of being the first surgeon to successfully complete the world's 
inaugural Mixed Reality (MR) guided spinal surgery. Dr. Wang offered insights into the 
use of surgical robots within hospitals. According to him, for doctors to utilize surgical 
robots, they must undergo a learning phase to become familiar with operating these 
advanced technological d evices before applying them in actual surgical scenarios. He 
believes that for young doctors, the support of surgical robots can expedite their 
learning curve for new surgeries, enhancing operational efficiency. However, for senior 
doctors with well -establ ished surgical skills, using surgical robots may require 
additional learning time, and practical application might not be as intuitive. This 
perspective underscores the importance of physician training and adaptation periods 
when introducing new technologi es to ensure the comprehensive application of surgical 
robots yields maximum benefits in the healthcare domain. Medical institutions need to 
formulate flexible training plans to meet the diverse needs of different groups of doctors.  
AI has made significant strides in medical surgery, encompassing intelligent 
surgical planning, robot -assisted surgery, and AI -driven augmented reality surgical 
navigation systems. These technologies are widely applied in clinical practices, 
providing conv enience for both doctors and patients. However, the development of new 
technologies is inevitably accompanied by ethical challenges and technical bottlenecks. 
Collaboration and communication between doctors and engineers are crucial to 
addressing technical  challenges, and new legal regulations need to be enacted to ensure 
the continuous development of medical technology remains centered around the 
interests of patients and healthcare quality.
