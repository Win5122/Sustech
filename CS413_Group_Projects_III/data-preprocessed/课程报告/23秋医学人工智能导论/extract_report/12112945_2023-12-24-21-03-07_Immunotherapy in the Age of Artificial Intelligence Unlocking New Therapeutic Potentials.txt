minimal human intervention. With the rapid development of technology, AI has become an important tool in the fields of biomed ical 
research and clinical treatment. The application of AI in medicine has formed a new medical model that improves or enhances the 
level of medical diagnosis, treatment, and management, possessing tremendous potential to revolutionize and reshape medicine.  
Particularl y in the field of immunotherapy, the application of AI is gradually changing our understanding and practice of disease 
treatment methods. This review aims to explore the application of AI in immunotherapy, especially in terms of target predicti on, 
drug dev elopment, and clinical care prospects and challenges. In addition, we also summarize d opinions on the challenges and 
opportunities related to the further application of AI in immunotherapy and its clinical practicality.  
 
INDEX TERMS  Artificial intelligence; Immunotherapy  
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
Artificial Intelligence involves creating algorithms and 
systems that can perform tasks that typically require human 
intelligence, which has evolved from basic computational 
models to complex algorithms capable of learning and adapting.  
Nowadays,  the convergence of technological advancements, 
the proliferation of data, and the increasing acceptance and 
investment in AI have collectively contributed to its 
widespread application across various sectors and industries.  
AI, particularly in the form of machine learning and deep 
learning, has become a pivotal tool in advancing biomedical 
research and therapy1. Machine learning  (ML) , a subset of AI, 
involves algorithms that learn from and make predictions or 
decisions based on data. Common machine learning algorithms 
include support vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), 
and Bayesian networks (BN) . Deep learning  (DL)  is a more 
complex subset of machine learning  in which a complex multi -
layered neural network architecture automatically learns data 
by transforming input information into multiple levels of 
abstraction2. These technologies are highly relevant in the 
biomedical field, where vast and complex datasets are common.  
In the realm of biomedicine, AI technologies are used to 
analyze extensive datasets such as genomic sequences, proteomic profiles, and clinical data. These analyses often 
uncover patterns and relationships that are not immediately 
apparent to human researchers. This capability is particularly 
important in immunotherapy, where understanding the intricate 
relationship between cancer cells and the immune system is 
crucial.  
Immunotherapy is a cutting -edge medical treatment that 
harnesses  the innate power of the immune system  by inducing, 
enhancing, or suppressing it to fight diseases, most notably 
cancer3. Unlike traditional treatments like chemotherapy, 
which directly target and kill cancer cells, immunotherapy 
works by either stimulating the immune system to attack cancer 
cells more effectively or by providing it with additional 
components, such as man -made immune system proteins. 
Immunotherapy has gained prominence for its potential to offer 
targeted, personalized treatment with potentially fewer side 
effects compar ed to conventional cancer therapies. Its 
applications extend beyond oncology, including treatments for 
autoimmune diseases, allergies, and even as preventive 
measures against certain infectious diseases. As research 
progresses, immunotherapy continues to e volve, showing 
promise as a pivotal approach in the future of medical 
treatments.  However, challenges like variable patient responses  
 
 2 and drug resistance persist. Here, we delve into how AI is 
becoming an indispensable tool in overcoming these 
challenges and advancing the field of immunotherapy.  AI, 
especially ML algorithms, can analyze vast amounts of 
biological data to identify patterns and relationships that might 
not be evident otherwise. This includes recognizing potential 
new targets which sets the stage for effective immunotherapy. 
Building upon the targets  identified, the discovery of effective 
drugs will be accelerated. Through s imulation and modeling, 
AI helps in understanding the efficacy and safety profiles as 
well as the synergistic combinations of drugs. Additionally, AI 
systems can continuously monitor patient responses to 
immunotherapy, enabling real -time adjustments to tre atments, 
potential side effects prediction , and decision -making aids.  
Overall, in this review, we summarized  the multifaceted 
role of artificial intelligence and mainly focused  on target 
prediction, drug development, and clinical care . The focus is 
on the synergy between AI and immunotherapy, highlighting 
the potential of AI to enhance the effectiveness and precision 
of cancer treatment . Immunotherapy in the age of artificial 
intelligence  holds the promise of more personalized, efficient, 
and effective medical care, while  it also presents challenges 
that need to be addressed to fully realize its potential.  
 
2. Immunotherapy  Targets Prediction  
In the modern medical field, particularly in cancer 
treatment, the integration of artificial intelligence is opening up 
new possibilities for therapies. Immunotherapy, which utiliz es 
a patient's immune system to treat cancer , relies heavily on 
accurately identifying effective targets to improve treatment 
outcomes.  In this area, AI helps in scanning large molecular 
datasets to pinpoint potential therapeutic targets.   
Through machine learning models, AI identifies genetic 
mutations and protein expression patterns related to cancer 
progression. These analyses help reveal biomarkers and 
potential therapeutic targets for cancer.  For example, u sing ML 
models, particularly classification algorithms based on single -
cell RNA sequencing (scRNA -Seq) data, a cancer stemness 
signature named Stem.  Sig was developed to predict different 
cancer patients' responses to ICI treatment. Additionally, key 
immune -resistant genes in Stem.  Sig were identified through 
statistical analysis of CRISPR datasets, highlighting them as 
potential targets for cancer immunotherapy4. Another s tudy 
demonstrates the effectiveness of  Extreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost ) algorithms  in predicting immunotherapy targets by 
identifying a set of 88 predictive genes from the data of 853 non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients, showing 
improved precision over traditional tumor mutational burden 
(TMB) methods5. A framework based on Deep Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNN), named DeepLRHE, utilizes whole 
slide images (WSI) of lung cancer from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) for model training and validation to predict the 
efficacy of immunotherapy  and identi fy biomarkers related to 
treatment response6. Meanwhile , mass spectrometry is a crucial 
method for analyzing the proteome, and the development of 
serum proteomic tests using machine learning algorithms 
through training datasets from cancer patients can be widely 
applied to identify biomarkers that predict the outcomes of 
immunotherapy in NSCLC patients7. 
AI also demonstrates immense potential in predicting 
tumor antigens. Tumor -specific antigens (TSAs) and tumor -
associated antigens (TAAs) are key targets for immunotherapy. 
Deep learning algorithms enable the effective prediction and 
selection of tumor antigens with therapeutic potential.  
Neoantigens are a type of antigen that arise from tumor -
specific mutations. They are essentially new epitopes formed 
when cancer cells undergo genetic mutations8. Recent 
advances in genomic and bio  information technology have 
made it possible to profile immune responses to personalized 
neoantigens encoded by tumor -specific mutations. However, 
timely and effective identification of neoantigens remains a 
major obstacle to personalized neoantigen -based cancer 
immunotherapy9. Generally, the identification of potential 
neoantigens involves several steps, including the identification 
of somatic mutations, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, 
peptide processing, and peptide -MHC binding prediction10. On 
the one hand, AI-based models can predict peptide -MHC 
binding specific to certain HLA class I alleles, an essential part 
of neoantigen identification. For example, the integration of 
ML algorithms such as MixMHCpred 2.0.1, NetMHCpan 4.0, 
and NetMHCcons 1.1 enhances the prediction of immunogenic 
peptides by considering additional factors like proteasome 
cleavage and peptide transport11 because  an important issue 
contributing to the relatively high false -positive rate is that 
current tools for predicting antigen presentation are mostly 
trained on in vitro binding affinity data, thus ignoring other 
factors12. On the other hand, c omplex computational 
algorithms based o n ML  have been developed to explore the 
nonlinear relationship between peptide sequences and the 
binding affinity with homologous MHC molecules, 
representing the high predictive accuracy of artificial neural 
networks13.  
 
 3 Moreover, understanding how tumors evade immune 
system attacks is a challenge in immunotherapy. The data 
analysis capability of AI makes it a powerful tool for exploring 
and deciphering immune evasion mechanisms, thereby aiding 
in the discovery of new ther apeutic targets14. Research shows 
that in high -grade serous ovarian cancer, the spatial variation 
of the intra -patient immune microenvironment shapes 
intraperitoneal clonal dispersion of tumors, where epithelial 
infiltration of CD8+ T cells  scored using AI and DP negatively 
correlates with malignant diversity, reflecting the 
immunological pruning of tumor clones15. 
In brief, AI has revolutionized the field of immunotherapy 
target prediction with its precision, speed, and data -handling 
capabilities.  This precision aids in the development of 
personalized treatment strategies, targeting cancer cells more 
effectively while minimizing damage to healthy cells.  
 
3. Drug Development  
3.1 Druggability Assessment  
Druggability is a criterion for assessing whether a drug 
can bind to a corresponding protein target and induce 
biological activity16, a crucial aspect of immunotherapeutic 
drug development. Statistically, the human genome 
encompasses a "druggable genome," containing approximately 
30,000 genes, but only a small subset of these are suitable for 
drug design17, making the evaluation of target druggability 
exceedingly important.  
3.1.1  AI-Based Web Server for Druggability 
Assessment  
Traditional analyses of druggability are resource -
intensive and time -consuming18; web -based analyses can 
significantly expedite this process. PockDrug -Server, a novel 
web server, predicts the druggability of holo and apo proteins19. 
Borrel et al. optimized a linear discriminant analysis model by 
utilizing fpocket for the estimation of the Non -Redundant 
Ligandable Domain (NRDLD) dataset and by selecting pocket 
descriptors from a set of 52 geometric and physicochemical 
descriptors. Seven stable and effective models were chosen 
through cross -validation and with four different pocket 
estimation methods using an independent NRDLD test set. 
These models contributed to the development of PockDrug20. 
The PockDrug -Server, based on PockDrug, can predict pocket 
druggability. Users can input protein pocket coordinates and 
receive druggability evaluations upon submitting the protein's 
PDB file19. Researchers have used PockDrug -Server to predict 
the druggability of BCL -2 Interacting Killer (BIK) protein, identifying five protein pockets with three showing a 
druggability probability greater than 0.5, offering data support 
for monoclonal antibody drug development targeting BIK21. In 
summary, as protein pocket research advances, more web -
based biological analysis applications are developed, enabling 
accurate assessment of anticancer targets' druggability and 
providing reliable druggable targets for immunotherapy in 
cancer treatmen t. 
3.1.2 AI -Based Machine Learning for Druggability 
Assessment  
AI based on machine learning aids in predicting protein 
structures to accurately identify protein pockets and target sites, 
as well as analyze drug molecule docking and target affinity. 
PockDrug relies heavily on precise 3D protein structures, the 
construc tion of which is time -intensive, thus greatly limiting its 
application. The widespread use of machine learning has made 
predictions of protein structures based on gene sequences 
increasingly viable, exemplified by the continually improving 
accuracy of Alph aFold. AlphaFold's innovative neural network 
architecture and training programs, informed by the 
evolutionary, physical, and geometric constraints of protein 
structures, have significantly enhanced the accuracy of 
structural predictions. In AlphaFold 2, re leased in 2021, the 
model achieved a median backbone accuracy of 0.96Å rmsd95 
(Cα root-mean -square deviation at 95% residue coverage)22. 
Researchers like Yang Jie have used deep learning with co -
evolutionary data to predict contacts and distances between 
protein residues, developing the trRosetta method. This method 
extends the machine learning -based prediction of protein 
residue distance s to predict residue orientations and is 
optimized using Rosetta. In CASP13 FM target tests, trRosetta 
outperformed existing prediction methods, thus proving its 
enhanced accuracy in protein structure prediction23. The 
progress in these protein structure prediction methods 
undoubtedly aids druggability prediction models like 
PockDrug.  
Molecular docking is a computational method for drug 
discovery, predicting ligand -target binding at the molecular 
level24. It first requires predicting the molecular orientation of 
ligands within the receptor, then uses scoring functions to 
estimate their complementarity25. For instance, aldose 
reductase, an enzyme linked to diabetes complications, was 
targeted by researchers using the ADAM&EVE program to 
search a 3D database, defining a 16 × 16 × 20 Å3 rectangular 
region encompassing the catalytic and G6P binding sites for  
ligand binding site conception. The CALGRID computer  
 
 4 program was employed to calculate van der Waals interactions, 
electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding energy at each 
grid point within the region (with a spacing of 0.4Å). Of the 
molecules ultimately selected, 30% exhibited inhibitory effects 
on aldose reductase, demonstrating the powerful capability of 
the molecular docking method26. 
 
3.2 Vaccine Drug Development  
3.2.1 Personalized Vaccine Development  
Artificial Intelligence can be harnessed to predict 
proteomic peptides and identify which of them can be 
presented by MHC molecules, thereby facilitating the 
development of personalized vaccines. Current prediction 
methods for MHC II molecules are predomin antly based on 
machine learning. These techniques are bifurcated into two 
main categories: allele -specific methods and pan -specific 
methods27. Allele -specific methods involve training models 
with a limited series of experimental data on peptide -MHC 
molecular binding affinities, which include approaches like 
simple motif sequences, hidden Markov models, and neural 
network models28. 
Due to the high polymorphism of MHC molecules, allele -
specific methods exhibit lower accuracy. In contrast, pan -
specific methods infer structural similarities or shared 
physicochemical binding determinants between HLA genes to 
predict the affinity of allel es not included in the training 
dataset27. Researchers have constructed a cross -allele 
predictive model that can utilize the amino acid sequences and 
structures of MHC II molecules to predict peptide -MHC II 
molecular interactions at three MHC II sites. They trained the 
model using a benchmark exp erimental dataset and measured 
its predictive performance with new data. The results 
demonstrated high accuracy, providing a theoretical framework 
for predicting peptide -MHC II interactions27. 
Artificial Intelligence can also distinguish between 
peptidic epitopes and non -epitopes using methods such as 
SVM, aiding in the assessment of a protein's immunogenicity. 
Gandharva and others collected experimentally identified 
immunomodulatory peptides to  construct a positive set for 
antigen -presenting cell  (APC) cell  epitopes and gathered 
endogenous cyclic peptides from humans to form a negative set 
for APC cell epitopes. Combining the positive and negative 
sets into a complete training dataset, a computa tional model 
based on SVM was developed, which could classify new query 
peptides as either A -cell epitopes or non -epitopes29, thereby 
aiding in the assessment of the antigenicity of target vaccine molecules.  
3.2.2 Vaccine Molecule Screening  
AI-based vaccine molecule screening can greatly enhance 
the speed of selection. In 2019, a newly developed influenza 
vaccine in the United States utilized AI for oligonucleotide 
prediction during its experimental phase, becoming the first 
vaccine identifie d using AI. This oligonucleotide sequence 
activates Toll -like receptors (TLR -9) in the human body, 
thereby promoting the production of cytokines and the 
expression of interferons, enhancing the vaccine's effectiveness. 
The construction of the oligonucleoti des began with the 
generation of over 10^16 oligonucleotide candidates by a 
computer program, followed by TLR -9 affinity selection using 
software trained on various TLR -9s, ultimately yielding the 
most suitable oligonucleotide sequence30. Traditional manual 
experimental methods for screening these nucleotides would 
take years, but AI algorithms can complete the process within 
weeks, significantly increasing efficiency.  
Furthermore, the involvement of AI also greatly improves 
the screening efficiency for protective immunogens. Protective 
immunogens are antigens that can produce memory cells in the 
human body. Dimitrov and colleagues utilized six different 
supervised machi ne learning algorithms (Partial Least Squares -
Discriminant Analysis (PLS -DA), k -Nearest Neighbors (kNN), 
Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
Random Subspace Method with kNN estimator (RSM), and 
XGBoost ) to test 317 known bacterial immunogens and 317 
bacterial non -immunogens. Validated through 10 -fold internal 
cross -validation on the training set and an external test set, 
these models showed good performance, with the XGBoost  
model standing out for identifying immunogens and the RSM -
1NN model being particularly effective for filtering non -
immunogens31. These models aid in better and faster screening 
for protective immunogens, enhancing the efficiency of 
selection.  
 
4. Clinical Applications  
4.1 Healthcare  
The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records 
(EHR) has resulted in a voluminous amount of health 
information that exceeds the processing capability of clinical 
doctors32. While these large datasets pose challenges for human 
analysis, they also create opportunities for the large -scale 
application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in 
healthcare. Marina and colleagues compared three machine 
learning models —Rand om Forests (RFs), XGBoost, and  
 
 5 Classification and Regression Tree —with Logistic Regression 
(LR) for predicting the risk of Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI). 
A cohort of 128 participants was divided into a 
training/validation set comprising 80% of the samples (102 
individuals) and a test set containing the remaining 20% (26 
individuals). The p erformance of the different models on the 
test dataset was evaluated using Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curves, Area Under the ROC Curve 
(AUROC), Area Under the Precision -Recall Curve (AUPR C), 
and F1 scores. A 10 -fold cross -validation framework was 
employed within the training/validation set to construct the 
models, which were subsequently assessed on the test set. All 
tested ML models exhibited high sensitivity and low specificity, 
indicati ng a significant advantage in screening for IEI33. The 
enhanced predictive capability provided by the ML models 
could serve as a resource for tracking IEI, offering reliable 
support for subsequent medical diagnosis, reducing referral 
delays, and thereby delivering better healthcare outcomes.  
 
4.2 Disease Diagnosis  
At the cellular level, deep convolutional neural networks 
have been utilized to identify different immune cells in frozen 
sections and their interactions, aiding in a better understanding 
of the immune system34. At the disease level, artificial 
intelligence can assist in the auxiliary diagnosis of 
immunological diseases by combining various clinical tests 
and examinations. Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) has 
become a major source of active tuberculosis (ATB ). Due to 
the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, the application of 
machine learning in the discrimination and diagnosis of LTBI 
relies solely on biomarker data, not clinical symptoms or 
medical imaging. Patients infected with Mycobacterium 
tuberculosi s initiate a specific immune response, resulting in 
variations in the types and quantities of mRNA in different cells. 
Machine learning methods based on microarrays offer a means 
to accurately differentiate between ATB and LTBI. In a study, 
differential ge ne expression analysis using microarrays and 
qPCR identified four biomarkers associated with ATB and 
LTBI differentiation: nuclear export mediator factor, asunder 
spermatogenesis regulator, DEAH (Asp -Glu-Ala-His) box 
polypeptide 29, and protein tyrosine ph osphatase receptor type 
C. Additionally, researchers utilized four classifiers —Decision 
Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Naïve Bayes —comparing the 
capacity of the four biomarkers to classify individuals through 
a 5-fold cross -validation method. It was found t hat models 
constructed with a combination of biomarkers exhibited higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to models 
constructed using a single candidate gene35. Moreover, 
machine learning can be applied to analyze RNA -seq and RT -
PCR data. In a study conducted in India, researchers employed 
RT-PCR and machine learning techniques to establish and 
validate a classification model. Upon cross -validation and on a 
separate validation dataset, the combination of just four genes 
was able to distinguish tuberculosis patients from healthy 
individuals with high accuracy, enhancing detection sensitivity 
while also reducing cost implications36. 
 
5. Discussion  
Immunotherapy presents a promising approach compared 
to traditional therapies, particularly in targeting malignancies 
to overcome the limitations of conventional treatments. 
However, challenges such as large -scale screening of drug 
targets and immune evasion by tumor cells persist. The rapid 
advancement of artificial intelligence, es pecially machine 
learning and deep learning algorithms, enables the swift 
processing of vast immunological datasets, like RNA -seq and 
protein structure data. This assists in molecular screening and 
predicting unknown protein structures after supervised tra ining 
with partial experimental data, thus improving the 
identification of drug targets, antigen screening, and the 
development of targeted immunotherapies or prophylactic 
drugs. AI ’s progress in image recognition also aids in 
identifying medical imaging data and analyzing changes in 
immune cells and active substances, enhancing clinical 
diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. Despite AI ’s advantages in 
sensitivity, accuracy, and high -throughput, issues such as 
patient privacy, dependence on pre -written algorit hms, and 
lack of adaptability remain. Most current machine learning 
models in immunology focus on inherent errors and target 
analysis in conditions like asthma and atopic dermatitis. 
Although AI has advanced to be directly applicable in other 
fields like r adiology with many software applications approved 
by the FDA as medical devices, applications in immunotherapy 
are still nascent. Future efforts should strengthen data privacy 
protection, enhance AI ’s learning capabilities, and leverage 
AI’s computational power for immune drug simulation and 
expanded applications to accelerate clinical trials and minimize 
harm to subjects. The prospect of AI in immunotherapy is 
broad, and more advanced algorithms are expected to 
accelerate the evolution of immunotherapy .
