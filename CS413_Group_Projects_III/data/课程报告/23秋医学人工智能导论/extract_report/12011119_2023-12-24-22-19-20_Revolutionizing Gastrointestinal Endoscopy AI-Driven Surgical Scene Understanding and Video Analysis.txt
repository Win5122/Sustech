rating AI into clinical practice, as well as the importance
of making these advanced technologies accessible globally.
Through this exploration, we aim to provide a comprehensive
overview of the current state and future potential of AI
in transforming gastrointestinal endoscopy and enhancing

II. GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY: SOPHISTICATED
IMAGING TECHNIQUES
A. OVERVIEW AND MARKET TRENDS IN
GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY
Gastrointestinal endoscopy is an advanced imaging technol-
ogy extensively employed for the diagnosis and treatment of
digestive system disorders, plays a precise and indispensable
role in clinical practice. In the United States alone, there were
approximately 15 to 20 million endoscopic examinations
conducted in 2016. According to statistical data, the market
size of this field reached $30.38 billion by 2022 and is
projected to grow further to $32.62 billion in 2023 with a
compound annual growth rate of 7.59%. It is speculated that
by 2030, the market size will soar to an estimated $54.56
billion [1].
VOLUME 1, 2023 1Gastrointestinal endoscopy primarily comprises two com-
ponents: endoscopy and intraoperative imaging systems. En-
doscopy functions as a detection instrument that integrates
image sensors, optical lenses, light sources, and mechanical
devices. The intraoperative imaging system performs tar-
geted image processing based on the specific characteristics
of different surgeries to meet clinical diagnosis and treatment
requirements. Gastrointestinal endoscopy enables direct ob-
servation of mucosal conditions in the esophagus, stomach,
duodenum, colon, and other digestive ducts while detecting
abnormal changes such as ulcers, inflammation, hemorrhage,
and tumors. Furthermore, it allows for biopsy or surgical
interventions such as polyp removal and stent placement
through endoscopic procedures [2]. Compared to traditional
surgical methods, this technique generally offers advantages
including reduced trauma levels, faster recovery times, and
enhanced safety measures. However, in most conventional
interventional endoscopy procedures, the anatomical targets
and positions of surgical tools cannot be observed within
the field of vision. Thus, surgeons anticipate obtaining clear
and intuitive visualizations of intraoperative images along
with accurate real-time localization capabilities for areas
of interest and surgical instruments; thus highlighting the
significance of developing advanced endoscopic navigation
systems.
The top ten topic areas in GI endoscopy were identified
by the editorial board of the American Society of Gastroin-
testinal Endoscopy through an extensive literature search
encompassing high-impact medical and gastroenterological
journals published in 2022. Remarkably, AI emerged as the
foremost area on this esteemed list. AI is being involved
in the clinical practice of gastrointestinal endoscopy tech-
nology at an alarming rate, and helping to improve a se-
ries of endoscopy content such as lesion detection, disease
classification, and real-time decision support. The field of
gastrointestinal endoscopy technology has witnessed signif-
icant advancements in the integration of AI. Researchers
have successfully utilized real-time AI to accurately predict
clinical recurrence in patients with ulcerative colitis, while
also developing deep learning tools capable of precisely
describing the location and severity of this disease. Two
meta-analytical studies demonstrate that assisted polyp de-
tection using AI significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy
and improves lesion detection effectiveness [3].
B. CHALLENGES IN TRADITIONAL ENDOSCOPIC
PROCEDURES
Despite the numerous advantages of minimally invasive en-
doscopic surgery compared to traditional open surgery, such
as significantly shorter hospital stays and recovery periods,
smaller incisions and scars, lower complication and trauma
risks, reduced pain and discomfort, and potentially lower
healthcare costs, it also faces several inherent challenges.
Firstly, in terms of perception at the surgical site, due to the
lack of depth perception and the complex topology and pho-
tometric characteristics of tissues, there may be blind spotsand significant visual changes during the surgical process, in-
creasing the complexity of gastrointestinal examination and
diagnosis [4]. Therefore, important lesions may be missed or
misdiagnosed, and certain tissue areas may be overlooked.
Secondly, regarding the operation of endoscopes and surgi-
cal tools, minimally invasive surgery requires precise naviga-
tion within deformed and narrow anatomical spaces, coupled
with the issue of disparate axes between the hand and eye [5].
This not only demands a high level of expertise but also re-
quires exceptional dexterity in handling surgical instruments.
In addressing these challenges, the application of artificial
intelligence technology offers a new perspective and solution.
By enabling AI to understand surgical videos, AI not only
has the potential to overcome existing limitations and address
issues of surgical scene perception and operation but may
also lead the future development of surgical procedures.
With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, par-
ticularly in the field of computer vision, over the past decade,
the next generation of interventional capabilities is likely
to be built upon AI modules that can extract information
from rich surgical records and provide computer-assisted
interventions (CAI) during and after surgery.
III. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN SURGICAL VIDEO
COMPREHENSION
All these advanced medical technology concepts are built
upon a crucial premise: achieving a deep understanding of
semantic information in surgical scenes through artificial
intelligence algorithms to effectively address challenges in
surgery. Computer vision, as an important branch of artificial
intelligence, focuses on enabling computers and systems to
extract, analyze, and comprehend complex information from
digital images or videos. This comprehensive understanding
of visual data allows for the automation and enhancement of
various tasks that traditionally require human vision. In the
context of gastrointestinal endoscopy and minimally invasive
surgery, computer vision algorithms play a pivotal role in
computer assist intervention.
A. COMPUTER VISION
Over the past two decades, computer vision technology has
experienced rapid development, which enables the aritifical
intelligence algorithm to fully understand the world by vi-
sion.
Initially, the field of computer vision relied on hand-crafted
features [6] and support vector machines (SVM) [7] for
image classification. With the advent of the deep learning
era, convolutional neural networks (such as AlexNet [8] and
ResNet [9]) made significant strides in algorithms. Recently,
algorithms based on Transformer models (such as ViT [10]
and Swin Transformer [11]) have brought about a new rev-
olution (Figure 1), excelling in various tasks on various
datasets (such as ImageNet, COCO [12]) including image
classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation,
sometimes even surpassing human performance in certain
aspects.

Transform). This process identifies and describes key points in the image, which are then utilized for image classification through a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

images to solve computer vision tasks. (c): Representation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, showcasing the application of attention mechanisms to image
processing, which has elevated the capabilities of computer vision algorithms.
In the realm of video understanding, computer vision has
also made remarkable advancements in related tasks through
innovative improvements to traditional deep learning algo-
rithms, such as the adoption of two-stream networks [13]
or three-dimensional video networks [14]. The development
of these technologies not only provides powerful tools for
analyzing surgical videos but also opens up new possibilitiesfor future medical applications.
B. SURGICAL VISION
In the field of surgical video analysis, a key task for artificial
intelligence is to deeply understand the surgical scene both
in terms of time and space. In the time dimension, AI needs
to identify the specific meaning of each moment in the
VOLUME 1, 2023 3surgical process. This understanding can unfold at different
levels, ranging from recognizing the overall type of surgery
to distinguishing specific actions performed by the surgeon
within a certain time frame, further to analyzing specific
activities within a few frames of video, and ultimately parsing
the specific actions taking place within a single frame. In
the spatial dimension, AI must interpret the content within
a single frame of the surgical video in detail. This includes
understanding from a broader perspective down to precise
recognition at different levels: first identifying the organs
and surgical instruments present in a single frame, then
determining the specific locations of these organs and in-
struments, followed by semantic segmentation of the organs
and surgical instruments, and finally achieving finer instance
segmentation of the organs and instruments [15] (Figure 2).
For various surgical scene tasks, there are now many
publicly available datasets for AI to learn from, such as those
for tool segmentation (EndoVis2018 [16], CholecSeg8k
[17], RoboTool [18]), organ segmentation (Dresden Surgical
Anatomy Dataset [19], SurgAI3.8K [20]), tool-tissue action
detection (CholecT50 [21], SARAS-MESAD2021, PSI-A V A
[23]), and skill assessment and workflow recognition (JIG-
SAWS [24], HeiCO [25], MISAW [26]).
Through this kind of video understanding, artificial intelli-
gence provides strong support for more precise and efficient
surgical assistance. This not only enhances the quality of
decision-making during surgery but also lays the foundation
for the development of future automated surgical technolo-
gies.
C. STSWIN IN SEGMENTATION TASK
In our final course project, we developed an artificial intel-
ligence model for understanding surgical videos, based on
the STswin Transformer [27]. This model innovatively em-
ploys the Swin Transformer across both spatial and temporal
dimensions, marking a significant advancement over tradi-
tional models that rely on CNN-LSTM aggregation mod-
ules. The STswin Transformer’s unique space-time window
shift mechanism enables efficient processing of spatial and
temporal information, leading to a more detailed pixel-level
analysis (Figure 3). This methodology effectively tackles
common issues in surgical video analysis, such as indistinct
decision boundaries and class imbalances. Additionally, the
model’s adaptable structure makes it suitable for a variety
of network configurations and applicable in scenarios where
understanding temporal aspects is crucial.
In our project, we implemented Dice loss for scene seg-
mentation using CholecSeg8k dataset. The model demon-
strates a certain level of understanding of the surgical en-
vironment. However, there remains significant room for im-
provement. It struggles with segmenting certain elements,
particularly small and thin objects like graspers, as well as
connective tissue, which tends to be less distinct compared to
other types of tissue.IV. AI IN SURGICAL VISION: DOWNSTREAM TASKS
The realm of modern endoscopic surgery is witnessing a rev-
olutionary transformation through the integration of cutting-
edge technologies. These advancements, primarily driven
by artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, are redefining
the landscape of minimally invasive procedures. With the
realm that artificial intelligence fully understand the surgical
scene by vision related algorithms, the implementation of
the systems is not just an innovation but a necessity in the
contemporary surgical setting. This section delves into the
pivotal developments and applications of these technologies,
including computer-assisted detection and diagnosis, endo-
scopic mapping, the emergence of fully automatic surgical
robots, surgical training, and automatic generation of elec-
tronic medical records (Figure 4).Each of these components
represents a significant stride in the journey towards more
accurate, efficient, and patient-centric surgical care.
A. COMPUTER-ASSISTED DETECTION & DIAGNOSIS
In endoscopy, computer-aided detection (CADe) and
computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) solutions are primarily
employed for the identification and classification of abnormal
tissue regions. Through learning and training, computers can
automatically recognize abnormal tissues and provide diag-
nostic assistance. Early CAD methods relied on manually
designed features, whereas modern deep learning techniques
leverage the intrinsic features inherent in the data itself for
learning, without assuming specific appearances or texture
patterns of diseases a priority. This enables a more accu-
rate and robust classification of abnormal tissues. CADe
and CADx systems have been successfully implemented
in various upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations,
significantly enhancing lesion detection rates and diagnostic
accuracy, particularly for colorectal tumors. Studies utilizing
state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based
on NBI technology have demonstrated that CADx methods
can effectively differentiate between five different types of
colorectal lesions with a precision detection rate exceeding
95% for colorectal polyps [28].
B. ENDOSCOPIC MAPPING, ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE
RECOGNITION AND NAVIGATION
Conventional endoscopy simultaneous localization and map-
ping (SLAM) approaches rely on complex photogrammetry
pipelines to infer the geometry and endoscopic displacement
of the gastrointestinal tract while capturing a series of en-
doscopic images. However, due to the intricate topological
characteristics of the gastrointestinal tract and Clinical emer-
gencies, such as hemorrhage, detecting and tracking visual
features pose challenges in endoscopy [29]. The incorpora-
tion of artificial intelligence has instigated a transformative
shift in various aspects of endoscopic navigation: Firstly,
CNN-based SLAM techniques enable direct estimation of
depth maps from a single monocular view, thereby obviat-
ing the necessity for visual feature tracking. In comparison
to conventional approaches, these methods exhibit precise

extraction. The model processes a sequence of four consecutive frames, effectively capturing and analyzing features from adjacent frames within the series [27].
mapping and positioning outcomes on extended colonoscopy
sequences, showcasing their efficacy in delivering accurate
results [30]. Secondly, Artificial intelligence technology fa-
cilitates precise recognition of anatomical structures during
endoscopic navigation, providing enhanced assistance. The
goal of anatomical structure recognition is to identify differ-
ent segments of the digestive tract as well as key structuresor landmarks. Studies have demonstrated that traditional
convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures achieve
classification accuracy rates exceeding 85% for these struc-
tures [31]. Moreover, artificial intelligence can be leveraged
to develop innovative robotic platforms and paradigms such
as magnetic endoscopes, which offer improved navigation
support.
VOLUME 1, 2023 5FIGURE 4. The infographic presenting the downstream tasks facilitated by advancements in surgical scene understanding. It illustrates the integration of computer-
assisted technologies in various aspects of endoscopic surgery, including detection and diagnosis, endoscopic mapping, navigation, anatomical structure recognition,
and the operation of full-automatic surgical robots. Additional applications highlighted include the use of AI for surgical training and skill assessment, as well as the
automatic generation of electronic medical records, demonstrating the comprehensive impact of surgical video comprehension on enhancing and streamlining
gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.
C. FULL-AUTOMATIC SURGICAL ROBOTS
Automatic surgical robots are robotic systems capable of
performing surgeries without human intervention, with a
primary focus on autonomy and intelligence. Autonomy
research emphasizes the independent decision-making and
operational abilities of robots during surgery, encompass-
ing path planning, tissue recognition, and execution. Intelli-
gence research centers around the perception and cognitive
capabilities of robots, including image processing, speech
recognition, and machine learning. Currently, certain studies
have achieved autonomous decision-making and operational
abilities in areas such as path planning and tissue recog-
nition. Moreover, advancements in robot intelligence have
been made through technologies like image processing and
machine learning applications. Automatic surgical robots
possess immense potential to enhance surgical procedures
through further research aimed at attaining higher levels of
autonomy and intelligence.
D. SURGICAL TRAINING AND SKILL ASSESSMENT
The assessment of surgical skills is employed to evaluate the
professional proficiency of surgeons during specific surgical
tasks. Currently, automated evaluation employing temporal
neural networks is the predominant method for surgical
skill assessment. These networks have been trained on theJIGSAWS dataset to differentiate between three levels of
physician expertise while identifying surgical gestures and
assessing skill scores in robot-assisted urology with an accu-
racy exceeding 95%. However, their effectiveness and impact
are limited by the absence of real clinical data. Additionally,
a three-stage temporal neural network approach has been
developed for laparoscopic cholecystectomy achieving an
average classification accuracy of approximately 85% on a
proprietary cholecystectomy dataset for distinguishing be-
tween proficient and inadequate surgical skills. Neverthe-
less, extensive clinical datasets are necessary to validate this
method’s reliability.
E. AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE ELECTRONIC
MEDICAL RECORDS
By harnessing advanced technologies such as machine learn-
ing and image processing, the automatic recording and anal-
ysis of surgical procedures can be achieved through video
data acquired from endoscopic surgery. These records en-
compass both functional and structural information about
the patient’s anatomy, accompanied by a comprehensive log
documenting events, activities, and procedures throughout
the surgical intervention. These comprehensive records can
furnish clinicians with meticulous information, facilitating
more precise diagnosis and treatment decisions.

A. LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES
Video is the most common data type in surgical phase
recognition. The current technological limitations hinder the
implementation of endoscopic video traceability, which ef-
fectively safeguards patient privacy and provides extensive
research opportunities for academic groups. However, irregu-
lar scenes present a significant challenge to endoscopic video
applications. Frames captured at the same stage may exhibit
substantial variations due to these irregular scenes. Sudden
movements of the endoscopic camera during procedures can
result in displacement and dislocation. Moreover, changes
in lighting conditions, blood, artifacts resulting from lens
cleaning processes, and other factors can adversely impact
image quality.
The acquisition of surgical video comprehension heavily
relies on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets.
Despite notable advancements in machine learning tech-
niques within gastrointestinal endoscopy, challenges persist
due to limited representative data labels and inconsistent
data quality. The performance of a proposed model trained
using a restricted dataset may be significantly affected when
applied to test datasets from unfamiliar medical sources.
Endoscopic images exhibit inherent heterogeneity, and their
high dimensionality and volume can substantially impact the
efficacy of computer vision systems [32]. In certain cases,
there might be an insufficient number of training samples
in the dataset to effectively train deeper or wider networks.
Although EndoVis, Cholec80, and JIGSAWS are currently
recognized as widely used public datasets, there remains a
need for larger and accurately labeled datasets to be estab-
lished.
With the increasing use of artificial intelligence in health-
care, ensuring the protection and confidentiality of patient
data has become a pressing concern. It is essential to establish
clear definitions of responsibility and legal liability for AI
systems used in medical diagnosis, treatment, and prediction.
Currently, there are gaps in laws and regulations pertaining to
AI assistance and automation, necessitating comprehensive
consideration and an appropriate solution.
B. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
The future of surgical artificial intelligence is poised to
be marked by significant advancements that will transform
the landscape of surgery and healthcare. Key developments
will focus on enhancing the precision and efficiency of AI
algorithms, particularly in the realm of computer vision for
more accurate analysis of surgical videos. There will be a
push towards creating larger, diverse, and accurately labeled
datasets to improve the training and effectiveness of AI
systems.
Robotics will play an increasingly pivotal role, with de-
velopments in autonomous surgical robots that integrate ad-
vanced AI for more precise and less invasive procedures.
Ethical and regulatory frameworks will also evolve, address-ing the responsibilities and liabilities associated with AI in
surgery and ensuring patient data privacy and security.
Additionally, AI’s role in surgical education and training
will expand, utilizing technologies like virtual and aug-
mented reality for immersive and realistic training experi-
ences. Lastly, efforts will be made to ensure global accessi-
bility of these advancements, making cutting-edge surgical
AI tools available in diverse healthcare settings, thereby
democratizing high-quality surgical care.
VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
